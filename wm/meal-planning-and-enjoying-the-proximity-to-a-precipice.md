![I think I need a new ribbon soon. It's suddenly taking noticeably more force to get the type to go down with the same darkness. There are some letters, like the 'e' in the 'the' in the last sentence that keep appearing more regularly. I'll go back and type over the really light ones. It feels like a bit of a waste since I really haven't used the bottom 1/2 of this ribbon. There doesn't really seem to be a need for the red ink. The only place i've used it is as the title for the weekly meal plans I've been typing up. I don't think I've written about those before… The idea is to fully plan out the week's meals on Sunday, and then go shopping sticking to the list. It's our attempt to lower our grocery bill while remaining satisfied with the meals we're eating. It's meant that we only need to go to the grocery store once per week, and we never have to think much about the thing we're cooking that night for dinner. We each have our own days that we cook, and we already have what we're making thought about ahead of time. This has worked out well in that pretty much every meal we've eaten since starting this little experiment has turned out quite good, and we haven't had to struggle to come up with something for dinner. The one area it hasn't worked as intended is in the grocery costs, as because we're preplanning the meals we put more thought into them and think of things that are a bit more expensive. Not that much more expensive than before, but all those meals that used to be filler (pasta or rice with whatever's in the fridge) are now replaced with actual dishes like fish or something. It's meant so far that our grocery bills have been a touch higher on account of some big-ticket purchases, like fish or shrimp or some condiment we just have to get. On the whole though, I think this new setup makes me feel much better, since the mental overhead that comes with planning that night's dinner is gone. Although our grocery bills are a bit higher, our overall spending on food is on the downwards trend since we've only been going out to restaurants once per month. Our feed is generally better, but it's nice to go out every now and then for the~experience. It feels like so long ago that we used to sit in our apartments in Pittsburgh and order food on Uber Eats. I remember we used to do it a couple times per week, and every dinner we got like that felt just kinda wrong. We recognized that it wasn't a good practice; I can't imagine doing that sort of thing every day and feeling like it was normal. I understand that this is the life of the recent graduate in tech, I'm glad I haven't been sucked in to that degree. It's nice to realize how easy it would be to return to that way of living, to recognize the edge of the metaphorical precipice and enjoy the view. 10:40PM / 48F / High of 59F / Windy, cool, drizzle and clouds clearing this morning to blue skies](images/30963033/QSReGGbDIL-daily.webp "")
