Boundary objects are physical manifestations of understanding. They sit *at the boundary* of multiple people's understanding. Boundary objects are how people all know they're talking about the same thing. 

Making effective boundary objects is one of the most difficult parts of [the craft of design](the-craft-of-design.md). It's a skill I'm especially interested in developing since it simplifies: complex and misinterpretable language becomes unnecessary when you have a clean visual representation of an idea.

I think I first heard the term *boundary object* from [Skip Shelly](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/martin-shelly), a professor I had at CMU. It's a really design-y term but is a pretty perfect description of the purpose these sorts of artifacts serve.
