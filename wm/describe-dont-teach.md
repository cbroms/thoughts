I don't know anything; nobody really does. We're all trying to figure out [the best way to live](how-to-live.md), the [sort of people we want to be](who-are-we.md), the sort of [ideas that inspire us](philosophy.md). 

Partway through this process--anytime, that is--people seem to want to evangelize their particular path. To teach others about the proper way to be. 

Perhaps rather than actively try and reach out and teach people about a particular way of life, passively document it. Allow people to peek in, engage with the documentation if they'd like. If they're interested, maybe answer their questions. 

People are not stupid. They make their best choices on their own. If there's something appealing about a way of life, or idea, they'll take hold of it. No need to hammer it into them as if they're an idiot--people see this and reflexively avoid the idea simply because it's being hammered.
