I don't read much. I prefer to [write](writing.md) or [think](reverie.md), or if in a [consumptive state](consumption-and-creation.md), watch something or play a game. 

Here are some of the books I've read or am currently working through:

- [*Critical Path*](critical-path.md) by Buckminster Fuller
