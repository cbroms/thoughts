I don't read much. I prefer to [write](writing.md) or [think](reverie.md), or if in a [consumptive state](consumption-and-creation.md), watch something or play a game. When it comes to books that are sort of [philosophical](philosophy.md), I tend to find that it's much more interesting to read once I've thought about the matter myself. Once I've got my own mental foundation, then I can come and engage with someone else's ideas; it keeps me from being too influenced from the outset. 

Here are some of the books I've read or am currently working through:

- [*Critical Path*](critical-path.md) by Buckminster Fuller
