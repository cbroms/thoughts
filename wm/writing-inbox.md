I've recently started keeping a small notebook for jotting down ideas as they come to me. It's been helpful in preserving thoughts that would otherwise float away.

There have been a few instances recently where I've been thinking about something right before I go to sleep or start some other task. I'll make a conscious effort to sort of "bookmark" the thought, but often when I come back later it's gone. 

It's a bit like I'm kayaking at sea, and I'm about to wash up on a beach. So I tie the kayak to some rocks, then dismount and wade ashore. When I come back later, the kayak is gone and all that remains are the rocks that I remember tying it to, along with a bit of rope. 

Avoiding these situations would be most welcome; hopefully my new writing inbox system can be of some help.
