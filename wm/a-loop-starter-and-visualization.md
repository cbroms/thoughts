![Today Sydney and I went for a walk out in the Marin Headlands from Muir Beach to Tennessee Valley and back. It was a route I'd never been on before, though I feel like I've definitely been on parts of it. It was a nice loop with a fair amount of distance (8.1 miles) and elevation (1800ish feet.) Not super varied in terms of biome; it was all that low coastal scrub. The perfect trail for views though, as you get a nice look down the coast to the City and are right there on the cliffs above the ocean. It was of course a clear and warm day; things are really starting to dry out a bit as it has been about a month since any rain. Looking forward to a break in the weather but it seems like for the next few weeks it's more of the same. So it is. My attempt at bread yesterday was an abject failure. The results were super dense with large caverns in the center, resulting in a slice with dense and chewy crumb around the crust and an empty nothingness in the middle. Leaves a lot to be desired. I think the problem is the starter. I swear everything else I did was exactly the same as what I did last week. The only difference was that the starter had been in the fridge for a while, as opposed to sitting out and being fed more often. This is truly all I can come up with for why there's such a big difference between the loaves. So I think the next thing to try is keeping the starter out and feeding it daily. I did notice a difference in the leaven, as yesterday I had to warm it up a bit to convince the yeast to do their thing in the morning, while before the leaven had doubled in size by the morning. I will give the starter a couple of days to refresh itself and try again mid-week or so. Weekend projects are progressing well. This evening I completed the history visualization project, which was quite fun. I ended up creating an SVG from the dates, showing the duration between each update to scale. Once I was working on it, I ended up rotating the line so it's sort of 45 degrees or so left to right, allowing the edit dates to nicely stack up and not run into each other. So the final height of the graph is based on the smallest duration and the minimum height that's associated with it. So if the smallest edit duration is a day, the whole graph scales such that the 1-day duration still feels nicely spaced apart. Setting aside most of tomorrow for finishing up the link preview project. 9:20PM / 50F / High of 64F / Clear and hazy](images/25711965/fhFVrREREr-daily.webp "")
