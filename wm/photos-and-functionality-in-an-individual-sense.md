![Today was a continuation of yesterday in that we mainly sat around and I finished planning the trip. We are now totally ready to go, or so I think. The plan seems pretty nice. Not too much movement but there should be a fair amount of variation to it too. I opened up my photos app for whatever reason this afternoon and ended up scrolling through a bunch of old photos from sophomore year of college. Most of the photos are garbage but I'm really appreciating the fact that simply having them and revisiting them every now and then is not something you do for the photos' sake, but for the memories they elicit. Cheesy as it sounds, there's something about pictures that brings back memories in a way nothing else really can. I had a very negative attitude towards taking pictures all the time, especially on vacations. But I'm really starting to appreciate it. In some sense the most valuable photos of all aren't the ones from vacations, but rather the ones randomly taken in the day to day. They often bring back totally unexpected memories. I've been trying to prevent myself from buying the iCloud photos storage plan, but now I'm starting to think that it could be a good idea. I've often thought that there's no reason to back up all these terrible photos and screenshots, that it's a waste of space and I could just go back and delete a bunch of stuff to clear space. But I think that just never going to happen, I've never been able to go back and prune out all the garbage because I don't really think of it as garbage. Everything contributes to the story, everything has some amount of value in the future precisely because it's a relic of the past made without any real reason. Just a piece of documentation. Renamed in as cheesy a way as possible, the "Photos" app should really be the "Memories" app. That's the real purpose it serves. Of course for anyone other than me or the people in the photos, all of this is less than useless, it really is wasted space. Someone elseâ€™s camera roll is totally useless to me, we're not focusing on the photos as pieces of art. They're decidedly not that. I think this is also why when people die so much of the stuff they own is garbage. It has no inherent value; the sentimental value is all it is. So it gets chucked out. But there's something also kind of strange about that, because you really do know that the only reason the stuff was there was for sentimental reasons, and now there's nobody there to use the object for its one and only purpose. So something that's functional looses its value the moment someone dies. That's a kind of strange thought, that there are things that aren't universally functional, that functionality can be a completely individual sort of thing. Seems like a pretty unusual sort of case. 9:30PM / 52F / High of 69F / Sunny with some high clouds](images/39675363/YirncJjqXm-daily.webp "")
