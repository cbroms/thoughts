![It's starting to feel like there's a big shift coming on. I’m starting to see the outcome of the war in Ukraine, and it's really looking like through that small action the future is being sketched out. No war with the U.S., but somehow there's been a shift in the global order. We may be getting a new benevolent dictator of the new-world. Not the U.S. and not Russia. I got to reading some counterpoints to some of the prevailing takes on the Ukraine war. Finally, finally some different perspective. Anyway, lots of likening Russia's position to something we might better understand. For example, the Chinese partnering with Mexico to build a military base on their land. The response of the U.S• government to a Mexican-Chinese military alliance is frankly hilarious to consider. Something tells me all this talk of self-determination and democracy would be absent. I think we'd get a very different sort of response. The CIA, I think, would get to work quick and we’d see some pretty well-funded cartels, all of a sudden. What's so bad about a narco state anyway? At least they ain't the fuckin Chinese commies on our front door! Point being, the U.S. and the west more broadly has fucked this whole thing up. A Chinese government official’s Tweet of a meme put it quite eloquently: the "International community" everyone likes to talk so much about is basically just the u.s., Europe, wealthy Commonwealth countries, and Japan. Everyone else is sort of shrugging. When the dust settles it seems like we'll start to see the new empire emerging and the old crumbling, slowly. All this geopolitical stuff is pretty fun to think about, for some reason. Totally futile and probably not worth wasting time on, but fun. I've spent much of this evening and last just kinda talking with Sydney. We stayed up far too late talking in bed, it's a bit of a problem. I don't know why it's so damn fun though. 9:15PM / 53F / High of 64F / Cool and foggy all day](images/44165582/PLLClwcnzr-daily.webp "")
