Spreadsheets, are, in my opinion, a high-water mark for the [design](design.md) of digital [tools](tools.md). 

It seems like there are three key points:

- The spreadsheet is incredibly simple, both in terms of the abstract idea of an infinite grid, and the interface that follows. 
- The abstraction naturally suggests a function, the formulas you can create to manipulate information follow directly from the clean and simple abstraction. 
- The interface is reactive; any modifications immediately update any dependencies. You're interacting with the abstraction at the same level both mentally and through the interface.
