![Just had a lot of fun arguing with Sydney about all sorts of stuff. I think the highlight was the fanfiction argument, in which I argued about the retardation of the endeavor. As usual, neither of us actually had a particularly strong opinion about any of the topics argued, we just find it extremely fun to do so. As for the day, it was fairly productive. Not much to note other than there is a project ongoing at work that requires my full concentration for a couple of weeks. Looking forward to knocking it out of the way; should be a satisfying one to complete given that it will be implemented quite immediately once I've finished, and I’m the only real designer working on it. What else to note. Sydney mentioned that since she'd started work these last couple weeks she's noticed how much noisier her head's felt. That seems pretty true for me as well. There's a noticeable difference between how my thinking seems to be on the weekend versus how it is during the week. Something about being in "work mode" versus not. It's not even that I'm actually working at night, I just tend to feel that there's more I'm actively thinking about than on the weekend when there's just less going on in my head. Or perhaps that the things that are going on in my head on the weekends are things that I have more control over and choose as topics of focus. As I mentioned before, I'm interested in ways of overcoming this weekday noise. some kind of way of quieting the mind. Meditation maybe, or something else. I'm not sure yet. Writing definitely helps a lot at getting things out of the head and onto paper. Then it's much more open and I can wander a bit more. That's the key then isn't it. Wandering. Daydreaming. All the interesting stuff comes while daydreaming. Need more time for that I think to be a more creative person. Or a person who has more to pull from in order to execute on that creativity.
