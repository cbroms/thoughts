![Spent the day out hiking in Pt. Reyes. We went on an eight mile loop from Limantour Rd up to the top of Pt. Reyes Hill, which is right next to Mt. Vision. Then down the hill all the way to muddy hollow (near the hostel) then back up to the road again. The weather out there was classic winter/spring sun and warmth. Perfectly blue skies, no wind, incredibly clear. As I wrote last weekend, another "reverie" day. It seems that this is the season of the reverie; if I was outside everyday, I'd be basking in the sun daily. Though I was thinking that perhaps because I only really am able to enjoy days like this on the weekends, perhaps that makes them all the more special. Or maybe that's me rationalizing the fact that I have to spend too much time inside and would be much happier if I didn't. After the walk we went down to the beach and joined the maybe 200 other beachgoers. We found a nice spot up in the sand dunes and sat in the sun for the remainder of the afternoon talking. There's something about that experience; people just seem made to sit on the beach. Or maybe the beach is the essence of a relaxing place to be, that it is the place people go for recreation and to feel free. Probably both are true, but the point is the beach is a unique place in the sense that there's a familiar script people seem to follow when visiting, a script that's based entirely around relaxation and enjoyment. Quite a special place. As we were sitting there in the sand, I resisted the idea about time being a sort of spiral. Sydney agreed and added an amendment: that the loops should occasionally touch as they wrap back around. In this way the same events and topics are re- visited without building on the previous year's modification, simply returning to the same ground. Now the image looks like this, a bit more wiggly. There's something about it that certainly feels correct. We just got back from having some El Salvadorian food for dinner at the place in Berkeley. Most excellent as always. As we were walking back I had an outburst about how much I hate the city; smelling exhaust, weed, and tobacco, having to skirt around people and having crackheads pop out of the woodwork as you walk by. Such an unpleasant experience next to the afternoon. Back now and still thinking of the beach, so that's good. 8:40PM / 48F / High of 64F / Clear](images/36387274/IdFtDvkZiI-daily.webp)
