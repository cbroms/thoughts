I'm not sure where I first saw this [diagram](boundary-objects.md), but it stuck with me. There's something about it that feels very correct. That time and concern is split across very many dimensions, that *meaning* is completely contextual. What matters in the stock market is very different than what matters in the development of a city, or the impact of a new way of farming on the world, and then anything beyond human. 

One thing that's not captured in the diagram but could be good to add is the directionality of the dependencies between dimensions. The position of a mountain, for example, has an impact on the local culture. The culture has less of an impact on the mountain (geologically speaking, that is.) The same is true further out: governance has more of an impact on infrastructure than infra does on government. But then there's the many small ways that infra does impact government that are worth considering as well...

Point being, it's a nice model that could use further color in the dependencies and interactions between layers.
