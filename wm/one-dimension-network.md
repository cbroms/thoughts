I was curious what this site looks like as a network, so I wrote [a little script](https://github.com/cbroms/thoughts/blob/8df65f4e5645091858505e267af6c1492387ee42/wm-scanner/graph.py) that visualizes it.

For the most part there's not a ton of highly-connected nodes; I imagine these will continue to emerge over time. As of today, Oct 10 2021, there's 51 thoughts total. 

I'd like to make One Dimension a more visual place to navigate through. I'm thinking that maybe exploring network connectivity can start to create some  kind of an emergent hierarchy. Highly connected nodes might be "centers" from which connected nodes inherit. It's one way you might have topics and areas of related thoughts emerge naturally rather  than through specific assignment by me. 

In all though, I think this illustrates that I need to return to this when I've written more. More thoughts will mean more connectivity, which will start to reveal something about the system as a whole.
