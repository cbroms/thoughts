I think the internet is the most extraordinary system to have ever been constructed. It is a marvel of [design](design.md) and engineering. 

And yet there's something extremely essential missing from it. 

It's missing everything about the world that's non-human. Interacting with the internet is such a [human-centric](who-are-we.md) experience: any physicality is so far abstracted away that there is nothing left of the [beyond-informational](spirituality.md) *quality* of the world.
