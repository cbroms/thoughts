I think the internet is the most extraordinary system to have ever been constructed. It is a marvel of [design](design.md) and engineering. 

And yet there's something extremely essential missing from it. 

It's missing everything about the world that's non-human. Interacting with the internet is such a [human-centric](who-are-we.md) experience that it can feel claustrophobic and lacking in physicality and *reality*. A land of make believe. 

*It is [my goal](hyperfov.md) to build tools for interacting with the web at an entirely new resolution.*
