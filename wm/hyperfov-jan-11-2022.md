Another interesting dimension here could be how a wayback machine like entity is constructed when you combine everyone's personal archives. Imagine each snapshot is served by an individual's archive via IPFS. Now every site has a series of snapshots that are distributed across a decentralized network of peers. Any kind of metadata layer could of course be equally well incorporated here, like links or comments. In fact, you could begin to construct a real repository of backlinks, since you'd know which site linked to any other given site. There are some extremely juicy possibilities here.
