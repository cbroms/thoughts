![I'm really doing an incredibly poor job of preserving enough time in the day for writing my daily page. Today that was because I spent pretty much the whole evening working on other projects. I just get so carried away! Anyway, the point is that this will be a very short page. All I have to note about my thoughts today is how crazy it is the amount of money there is to be made in technology. You can make so much more than quite a lot of the workforce simply by being in this field. This is one of those things that I know, but I'm constantly awed by how true it is, and how stark the difference between tech and all other fields is in terms of compensation. Quite incredible, for better or for worse. 10:00PM / 51F / High of 66F / Mostly clear, a few high clouds](images/25750500/BrZOvHYtmN-daily.webp "")
