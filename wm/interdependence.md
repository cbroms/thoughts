If there is one lens that has changed my perspective most, it is the lens of interdependence. Through this lens, I focus my attention on the ways everything around me depends on everything else. 

It's truly amazing to consider how much I and others rely on certain goods and services. Trying to enumerate them makes the complexity of the world more and more phenomenal. 

It's worth asking if increased interdependence is a positive byproduct of progress.
