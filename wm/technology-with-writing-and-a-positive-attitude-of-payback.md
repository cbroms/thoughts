![Of all the ways that technology has changed different forms of artistic expression, it seems to have done the lea9t thus far to writing. For some reason or another, writing seems to have remained pretty much the same format it did before much of the technological change of the last 50 years occurred. Video, image, audio have all changed. But writing has not. It's still black text on a white page, either digital or paper. And to publish writing you still pretty much need to go through the same publishing gatekeepers you always have. It feels like a medium that's particularly ripe for some sort of innovation. Or maybe the fact it hasn't changed is evidence that there's something about it that's as essential as possible, and can't really be changed without ruining its underlying essence. The publishing aspect, at least, is really ripe for change. Surely there is a better format for this, some way for anyone to publish and distribute , some way that's as open as YouTube is for video. I was thinking today about how one of the most powerful motivators seems to be when institutions reject people, and they go "fuck you" and do their own thing. Then that new thing completely destroys the old institutions. That feels like some sort of most essential sort of story, there's something uniquely compelling about that sort of "I'll show ‘em” attitude. I've certainly felt it a few times, not that I've really acted on it in a meaningful way. But it feels powerful, the sort of force that surely drives real change. 10:40PM / 55F / High of 75F / Clear and sunny](images/92996025/wzekGwopBv-daily.webp "")
