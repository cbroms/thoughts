The process of reflection is something I'm finding to be an excellent addition to my routine. 

I don't mean just being more reflective throughout the day (whatever that actually means), I mean specifically setting aside [a part of the day](principles.md) to reflect on the current, past, and future states.  

It's as simple as talking with my partner about how our days went. We make an extra effort to think *beyond* just the basic "good" or "meh" and try to dissect they day's experiences and whatever's currently going on in our lives. 

Something this has revealed so far is that there are certain themes that we return to over time. Individual experiences, when considered more, link to recurring events or common prototypical experiences and themes.
