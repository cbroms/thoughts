Another potential use case I was considering today has to do with curating search results. 

Maybe there's a way you denote a page is a high-quality result. As in, you search, then when you find what you're looking for, then mark that page. The next time you search for something similar, that marked page bubbles up to the top. 

This historic context could be quite powerful when integrated into a new session; you can reuse past experience to improve future experience.
