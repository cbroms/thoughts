This was the first year I had a *real* job. 

Before we started working, Sydney and I got pretty deep into exploring [the strategies around investing](progress-and-the-stock-market.md) and [how to handle money](fire.md). I'm glad we did that, since I'd never *properly* learned about [money](money.md) and how to think about it. 

I started work during the summer, so this for around half the year:

```text
Total Income (pre-tax)          $69,475.00
Total Savings/Investment        $18,685.30
Total Spending                  $17,903.00
Excess Cash                     $6,443.70
```

Resulting in this breakdown:

```text
Savings Rate    26.89%
Spending Rate   25.77%
Tax Rate        38.06%
Remaining       9.27%
```

I was a bit nervous about letting the bank account get too low and investing every last bit, hence the large amount of excess cash. This year I'd like to hit a 40%+ savings rate, which should be doable with a bit of a reduction in spending and cutting the excess cash. Given Sydney and I were starting with pretty much nothing, we had to buy all the essentials to get set up, so a much slimmer spending rate this coming year is quite possible.
