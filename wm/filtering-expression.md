Everyone expresses. But how much to they filter their expression, how well can they  tune it in for a particular context or audience?

Functionally speaking, it's an essential skill to be able to filter expression. Knowing what to say, how to say it. Most people just *do* it, unconsciously or consciously. 

But everyone also needs a time to remove the filter, to just express in the way truest to their nature. They need places where this is possible, people they can reflect raw thoughts off without bounds. It's up to everyone to figure out what form of expression works best for them. Quietly, loudly, it makes no difference. Express truly. That's all.  

*The capability for unfiltered expression is an absolutely essential part of being a free person.*
