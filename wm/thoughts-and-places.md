I very strongly tie places to memories and thoughts. I'm sure others do this, but I find myself noticing it quite a bit. 

I'll be thinking about something at a particular location, and when I return to the location I'll remember it again, and vice versa. 

It often happens when I have a conversation with someone. My partner and I will be talking about something, and I'll immediately remember back to when we talked about that thing before. "Remember when we were driving away from Spokane towards the Cascades and talking about this?" I guess not. 

It's sort of like a [flashbulb memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashbulb_memory), but just with location and the most salient piece of metadata. And it's not with super life-changing events either; it's mostly more ordinary thoughts. It's a weird sort of [episodic memory](episodic-memory.md) thing.
