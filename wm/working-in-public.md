There's something about the idea of working in public that I  quite like. That's digital-public, not public-public. 

Digital-public means that the artifacts of your work are accessible though a web browser. Your [process](process.md) is publicly accessible. That's all. 

It's important to note that:

1. Work is not done *solely for the purpose of being public*. 
2. Publicly accessible does not mean *marketed*. Someone could stumble upon it, but it's not put in front of them unless both you and they want it to be.  
3. There is a *limited and [often scrutinized](reflection.md)* feedback loop between viewer and creator. Public feedback on work should be processed but not consume the creation of new work, as reflected by the first point.
