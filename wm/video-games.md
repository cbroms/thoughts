I've been playing video games since I was a teenager (shocking, indeed). While I play significantly less often than I did back then, I still get quite a bit of joy from the occasional Battlefield 4 match. 

It's really meditative. You can get into a sort of [consumptive/creative](consumption-and-creation.md) mix where you're both thinking and not thinking, acting strategically and automatically. It's fun but still a bit challenging. 

Yes, there are real downsides to video games. They are a time sink and will suck up more energy and motivation than they should. But taken in moderation, they can bring great joy.
