![It's becoming ever more clear to me that I work in these sort of cycles of creativity. Iâ€™ll have some problem to solve. I think about it, usually for a good week or so before I actually start working. And I'll often get conceptually stuck a few times over the course of that time, not really making much progress on the design. And then, usually when I'm not really thinking about it, some solution will come to me. I'll think I have figured it out, the design will start to form in my mind. So then I'll start actually sketching it out, playing around with it outside my head in a new context. And inevitably, it'll turn out that the approach I thought was the correct one was not. So I'll keep messing around with it some more until I get stuck again. After that, it's back to thinking. This second phase of thinking can often take much longer than the first. And it'll often also involve going back to the design when I think I have a new approach and trying it out. But nothing really works. Finally, after perhaps a very long time, the absolutely correct answer will arrive. It'll be prompted perhaps by some conversation or feedback, or something else that I'm working on, or something that I saw that was seemingly unrelated but turned out to have the seed of an idea in it. By absolutely correct what I mean is the solution feels correct. It is certainly not the only possible solution, but it is the first one I encounter that feels holistically right. It satisfies everything, and for that reason I'll go with it. More, of course, can be made to improve on it, but the fundamental identity of the idea is the right one. So really the key to it all is time and exposure to seemingly unrelated domains, concepts, and tools. Though those the spark of the idea is carried, and the interaction between it and the problem space results in the correct answer. 5:30PM / 64F / High of 68F / Windy, foggy, then sunny](images/10132531/OaoPyodYKT-daily.webp "")
