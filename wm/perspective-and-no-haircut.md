![I started a new journal on FL to track a little summary of the work week. The idea is that every Friday I'll go in there and summarize how the week went. I've been feeling like these weeks haven't been as productive as I'd like, and it seems like the problem is more a problem of perspective or long-term goals and a trajectory than a short term issue. It's not like I’m just not working at all, on the contrary I'm getting plenty done, just that the things I'm getting done are a bit small and don't feel like they're contributing to the overall thing I’d like to be building. Anyway, hopefully by forcing these moments of reflection I'll be able to more effectively find ways to classify and overcome the vision-related things that seem to be coming up. Not sure why I said "things" there, need to stop using filler words. Vision-related aliments, perhaps. Or roadblocks. Not a big fan of that word. Blocker, if I wanted to sound annoying. What else to note? My hair is getting really long. I don't remember when it was I got my last haircut, November maybe. Just kept putting off getting a haircut, and Sydney has been telling me to grow it out for a while now, so that seems to be what's happening. I just gotta get over this awkward stage where it's too short to comb back and too long to flip to the side as I normally do. I remember the last time I did this was during the initial COVID lockdown, and I think I must have gone about six months before I finally got a haircut. By the end of that it was looking pretty decent, I think. We'll see how it goes this time. I've really been dreaming about getting it buzzed all off, I think that would be a pretty decent look for me perhaps. Well maybe not look, but more like philosophical approach. I just like the idea, it seems simple, clean, and unpretentious. Minimal. We'll see what happens. 7:10PM / 60F / High of 62F / Clear and sunny](images/84431291/hRyRPEfxkJ-daily.webp "")
