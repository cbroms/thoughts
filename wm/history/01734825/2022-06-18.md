We went on a little scouting trip up to Washington state this Memorial day. 

## Day 1 

The flight into Seattle was fantastic. As we got out of Northern  California and into Oregon, it started clouding up and the ground  became obscured. Every now and then I'd catch a little glimpse of  forest or fields below, all mysteriously green and inviting. Eventually we descended and the landscape was revealed; evergreens, light green maple trees, green grass, and black shining roads. Coming from the bone dry bay area, it was like we were entering an entirely new world. 

The plane got in at 7PM, and we picked up the rental car after the additional $400 or so of tacked on fees (ready to be above 24 so they don't keep charging the young driver fee bullshit.) We got a silver Toyota Corolla that absolutely reeked of cigarettes. 

After that we swung by REI in Bellevue and picked up a couple of rental camping chairs and a stove. We had dinner at this popping sushi restaurant in downtown Bellevue. Seemed like they were basically subsidized by Microsoft; everyone there had that sort of look. It was very tasty though. $95 later, we were back on the road. 

The drive reminded both of us a lot of western Pennsylvania, with the low rolling hills. Something about that area feels like very much a cross of the east and west coasts. 

We got into our cabin outside Bellingham pretty late that night. It was really nice though, totally detached from the owners' residence and a great size. 

## Day 2 

The next morning we woke up and drove up to Bellingham. We stopped on the way at Fred Meyer and picked up some groceries and propane. Nice store, they seemed to have everything you'd need. 

After that we went into downtown and ate lunch at this Peruvian place. The people there were *weird*, there was very much a strong liberal arts college-Tumblr sort of feel. Stranger than Berkeley, even. 

Then we went over to Fairhaven, a little historical district a mile or so south. The original goal was to visit a used bookstore, but it turned out that they were having a town fair sort of thing, with food and vendors and live music. It turned into a perfect opportunity to check out what sort of people lived around the area. Turned out they were pretty much the same as here, just paler. 

Having browsed through the bookstore, walked around a bit, eaten some ice cream, and walked down the shore, we departed. We drove in a northern loop through Deming, a great feeling valley surrounded by the foothills of the Cascades. From there we joined with SR 20, and drove east up into the mountains.

I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that drive. It started to could up and rain a bit, and we drove through these fields of bright yellow flowers with huge mountain faces jutting up on the periphery. There was this one scene that burned into my brain: one of those yellow fields full of brown cows, a man and his dog making his way to the cows, sun shining down and light raindrops hovering in air, and in the background dark evergreens on a massive mountain towering above, the cloudline just revealing a bit of snow above. It was the sort of thing that was almost too gaudy; it had everything perfectly composed. 

We set up at the campsite and made some mac and cheese for dinner.

## Day 3

It rained all night, but our new tent held up really well and we were totally dry. 

We had some soup for breakfast, then drove up to Baker lake to go for a hike. We hiked along the side of the lake for a while. It was incredible out there, an enchanted wonderland if there ever was one.

That was pretty much it for the day. We drove back and made some rice and beans for dinner. 

## Day 4

We got up and had the usual soup for breakfast, then packed up and departed. We drove west on SR 20 out to Burlington and on to Anacortes. It was a pretty nice little town, lots of little  restaurants and shops. After walking up and down the main street trying to find just the right place for lunch, we eventually settled on a Mexican restaurant. It was kinda meh.  

After that we went into another used bookstore, this time with some really nice books inside. It seemed like the bookshelves were all handmade from plywood; the whole thing seemed to have this warmth about it. Really nice spot. 

We drove south through Whidbey Island down to Coupeville, where we took a car ferry across to Port Townsend. I think this drive and ferry were some of the most scenic parts of the trip--you could see the massive white peaks of the Olympics at every crest. Combined with inlets, boats, green fields, and windswept trees, the whole thing was perfect. 

From Port Townsend we kept driving south down to where we were staying--a guy's cabin somewhere out in the woods. It was a really nice setup; he clearly had built it himself and everything was off-grid. There was no toilet and the water came from a rainbarrel setup. 

That night Sydney and I got really excited about an idea to build cabins like this ourselves and rent them out. This guy's cabin was great, but it wasn't arranged in a particularly nice way and the furniture was a bit nasty. With a few tweaks, you could totally build a cabin that anyone would want to live in for a while, especially in a spot like he had. We figured you could keep the whole thing really low-cost and still make something incredibly nice. 

This discussion occupied us all the way through dinner that night in Port Townsend at a local Italian place, and back to the cabin.  We decided that we should adjust the second part of the trip accordingly, to go see the Eastern part of the state a bit where the cheaper land was. 

## Day 5 

We got up and drove west on the 101 to Port Angeles, another nice little town. There we had breakfast at this breakfast that for some reason had vegan versions of everything on the menu, but not vegetarian versions. Sydney's vegan eggs were surprisingly good though. 

We went to yet another used bookstore next door, then to the most expensive health food grocery store I'd ever seen, then departed for Olympic National Park. We entered at Hoh Valley and drove up to the campsite. It was once again pouring rain, but beautiful and super mossy. The forest did have a slightly different feel than the North Cascades; a bit less ferny and a bit more open and mossy. We went for a hike to Sol Duc Falls, then up a trail with the intention of going up to an alpine lake, but as soon as we hit the snowline it started raining and we turned back.

By the time we got to the campsite and set everything up, we were soaked. It didn't stop raining. So we had some nice soup and noodles for dinner.

## Day 6 

We woke up after another night of rain, not wet but still feeling pretty damp. Hoping to find a drier climate, we set out for Leavenworth. 

We drove south around Puget sound through the islands on the west side. There were some really nice green valleys and farms, it seemed to me to be a fairly nice place to do some homesteading. As we got further south it started to get a bit suburby, and finally we made our way to the east side of the sound in Tacoma. We drove north up the 5 until we completed the loop around Bellevue. We then headed west again, this time on Highway 2. 

Again, as we neared the mountains it started to get really dark and threatening, then absolutely dumping. Another beautiful valley though, much like SR 20 but a bit more open. We drove over Stevens Pass, which was still totally snowed in. 

I'd scoped out a campground to try outside Leavenworth that didn't have any reservations left, but evidently had first come first served sites. We got there and it was *still* raining. This was the East, it was supposed to be dry! 

After scoping out the options a bit, we elected to forgo the camping seeing as it was likely to be another night of rain. So we booked a last minute hotel in Leavenworth at a very reasonable rate of around $100. The drive from Lake Wenatchee to Leavenworth was really nice, we went through the little town of Plain and another incredible valley. This had a much more familiar vibe to me; fields of wheat being cultivated along the river and cabins and houses nestled in the trees around. A much drier sort of environment, but still raining. We got to the hotel and had some soup, took a little walk around the town, then went to bed. 

## Day 7 

We got up and packed up our stuff, then headed out for a hike outside Leavenworth. We climbed up into the National Forest land overlooking the valley. Everything was in bloom it seemed, and there were fields of lupine and sunflowers everywhere. As we were walking, it started raining *again*, despite the forecast assuring us it would not. But it created these incredible clouds over the whole scene...

After our hike, we went back into town and found the one Mexican place to eat, avoiding all the thematic german food. It turned out pretty decent. We decided that night we'd go into Seattle and stay there rather than camping, now totally done with the rain. We took another walk through the town, toured another used book store, then departed. 

We drove south on highway 97 to the 90, then over the mountains again. And of course it rained again. 

On the way, we stopped over at some random campground to stash the propane as a gift whoever visited next. 

Then we stopped over in North Bend and saw all the Twin Peaks locations like the R&R diner and the lodge with the famous waterfall. It was worth the stop, pretty cool to see the same thing we'd seen however many times in the show in real life. 

Finally we made it to our hotel in Seattle after many parking-related shenanigans. We had dinner at this Japanese-Hawaiian fusion place, which was quite good. It was quite a shock being back in the city and being around city people again, the tech vibes were strong. 

## Day 8  

We decided this would be the day to explore Seattle a bit. So we started by continuing our tour of used bookstores and visiting a couple in Capitol Hill. Man, was that a crazy place. The people there were *insane*. And the graffiti! I'd never seen such graffiti, it was calling for the end of civilization, the end of all sorts of things, including the lives of police officers. What a place. 

We decided to head to a different area of the city for lunch: the international district (China/Japan town, basically). We had some really good noodles and found ourselves amongst normal people, which was nice to see. 

Then we drove through the city to Discover Park, which reminded me a lot of Pittsburgh's parks. Lots of leafy deciduous trees. We sat overlooking the sound and reflected on the trip and our next steps. 

We went to the next place a bit early, as we were itching to sit down at the computer and construct a spreadsheet comparing the three different regions we'd visited: the north, Olympic Peninsula, and east. So we drove out of the city to Carnation, a little town in a valley east of Seattle, just to the north of North Bend. 

The converted basement was nice, as was the area. It rained, so we sat inside, made our spreadsheet, made some pasta in the provided kitchen, and watched some episodes of Westworld. 

## Day 9 

We awoke, packed, and drove back to Bellevue to return the rented camping gear. It rained a lot, shockingly. Gear returned, we drove back to the airport and returned the car. Lunch at the airport, and a nice short flight back to Oakland. 
 
Emerging in Oakland, it was so nice seeing the sun. I think Sydney finally gained an appreciation for the sun after over a week worth of rain. I was remarking when we were in Bellingham that she had a sort of glow to her, because everything around was so grey and pale. 

That was the trip. I enjoyed exploring these new areas and old of Washington. The weather caused some  complications, but it also caused some really beautiful moments we wouldn't have otherwise experienced.

Of all the places we visited, we decided the east was the place to continue to pursue. It seemed to have all the qualities we were looking for: real winter, sun for growing, sparse, lots of cheap land, proximity to incredible mountains...

Looking forward to going back.
