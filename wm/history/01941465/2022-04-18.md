- 2 large russet potatoes 
- 1 cup flour
- 1 egg

Peel and cut the potatoes into largish chunks. Boil in salted water until tender. 

Pull the potatoes out of the water and let cool. Crush with a ricer, then add the flour and egg. Mix until a dough forms. 

Turn out onto a floured board and knead a bit until smooth. Let rest 20 mins. 

Cut into four or five pieces, and roll out into a long rope. Cut into little pillows. Take each piece and roll against the back of a fork to form a dent on one side and lines on the other. 

Boil the gnocchi until they float to the top. Scoop out and serve.
