![I have awoken today to find everything outside soaked in a layer of moisture. Some rain has finally fallen. It's been about two and a half months now since any significant rain. At first I was sort of convincing myself that this was fairly normal, but over time it became stranger and stranger just how dry it was for the rainy season. It's been nothing but blue skies for two months. As much as I love this place, I really like the rain too. Sydney and I are talking about moving somewhere else in a bit under a year from now, and I think it's worth considering that the place should perhaps get a bit more regular rainfall. Or perhaps itâ€™s one of those things where because it is more scarce here, I enjoy it more. Hard to say, as I don't remember enjoying the rain particularly in Pittsburgh. Of course I liked it, but I don't recall feeling any more content here than there or vice versa. Something I'm trying today is the two-part daily page. I'm writing this part in the morning, and later on this evening come back and finish it. Curious to see what happens if I keep up with this format for a bit.Right now it's 8:15AM, 55F, and drizzling. I'm off to work. Ok, back 12 hours.later. Amazing how long 12 hours can feel, it seems like I wrote this yesterday. Nothing too much to note about the interim. Spent the day in the office doing meetings and a design review. Listened to a podcast about the origins of life and life in the universe on the way to and from the office. Got home and went for a walk with Sydney while talking about resumes and the ethics of inflating your experience, for whatever reason. Got back home and did a bit of browsing around while Sydney made fish potstickers for dinner. Ate them (they were excellent) and now I'm here typing. Feels like a pretty pedestrian sort of routine, all written out like that. I can't predict if this is the sort of thing I'll cherish or hate in the future; if this particular moment of my life will be something I see fondly later. That's the tricky thing, often how I remember something later is quite different than the way it was in the moment. I romanticize it. What I'm often missing later is a truthful portrayal of the particular time written in the moment. Of course the feeling will change in the future, but how does it feel *now*? This seems like the question to be asking myself when I write these pages: how does life feel now, today, in this moment? 8:15PM / 55F / High of 64F / Partly cloudy, some incredible clouds caught on the peak of Mt. Diablo and streaming over the hills on the peninsula.](images/41595510/JATQmTKznz-daily.webp "")
