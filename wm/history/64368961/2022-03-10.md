![This evening I *think* I'm going to start working on this digital article thing I've been talking about for a while now. It's been fermenting for a while in my mind and I think the only way to continue with it is to start to make it a bit more concrete. So let's think through it. The idea, at a high level is to explore what makes an interface *feel* quick. Not an interface specifically, but rather any kind of digital system. As you're interfacing with it and providing some kind of input, it's producing some kind of output. The way the system feels is a function of the initial queues, the input, and the output. Maybe not the output itself, but the conditions that surround the output. The way the system was behaving to produce the output. That seems like a decent way to think about it. It's the way the system behaves. Not in a basic way, purely in terms of information transfer or what appears on screen when. But rather about the patterns of behavior that appear to govern the system's actions. Much like a person. More concretely, I'd like to explore a few examples of a very simple stimulus and response. Check a box, and the system responds by updating in some way. The question explores is: how do different responses from the system in response to this stimulus change the perception of the system's feel? For example, one question might be around the amount of time it takes for the system to respond to user input. What is the amount of time it takes for the system to feel clunky? Now add a loading indicator. How long does it take for the system to feel clunky again? A progress bar, same question. A different presentation of the action, perhaps through some sort of modal instead of the checkbox. Same question. Something I've always wanted to do is collect this sort of question's answers through some sort of survey. If this is an interactive page, the survey can be part of the experience. Just like in story games where you can see what percent of players made each choice, here too you could see other's determinations of the amount of time it takes to make a system feel clunky under each condition. Theres the enjoyability that comes with interacting with these little toys and figuring out how they feel for yourself, and then there's the little bit of driving motivation that comes with seeing what others thought as well. Everyone likes to see what other people thought. 5:45PM / 65F / High of 70F/ Clear and sunny](images/64368961/pGSGNONWaR-daily.webp "")
