I came across [this article about GPS](https://ciechanow.ski/gps/) a couple months ago and it's really stuck with me as a particularly *fresh* sort of presentation of information on [the internet](the-internet.md). 

It's so clean, so well thought out. Each little interactive example contributes to the overall piece. The author barely needed to write any text; the information just sort of emerges as you scroll through and interact with it.
