![I'm out of time tonight, so I'll write down what happened today in a series of bullet points: - Work, - Walk with Sydney, - Sitting outside working, - Some eggs and tortillas for snack, - Costco with Sydney, - Quinoa, cauliflower, and kimchi for dinner, - Baking some coffee cake. Now we're going to watch a movie, since it's Friday. The whole day was sandwiched, glued together with a pretty much constant discussion with Sydney about the usual this and that of life. Pretty nice day.](images/12177318/jiEXDhGDPt-daily.webp "")
