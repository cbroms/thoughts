![I woke up today thinking about feeds on Futureland. Or streams as I'm calling them. I figured it would be helpful to dedicate a page to thinking about them a bit more. It appears as though streams serve two primary purposes: 1) To break down activity into more meaningful chunks. For example, you might want to see the activity of a subset of people, or journals all related to a certain topic like drawing. This already kind of exists in the All / Myself / Following split of the main activity feed. This would essentially just afford people more granularity in how they'd break up activity. 2) To facilitate a community. Right now FL as a community exists because of the ' 'All' tab of the activity feed. However, there are plenty of instances where it'd be nice to break it down a bit more and hang out with a smaller group of people, and perhaps discuss shared journals. The stream is where that happens. To me this suggests quite a few possible directions. In v particular, it suggests the need to introduce a new layer of relationship between journals and entries on FL. If I'm someone who's interested in design, for example, how would I know which of the many journals on FL are design-related without having first gone through them all? It's a bit of a chicken-and-the- egg sort of problem. We need a layer that relates journals by their process. Tags, I think, are what will address this. The next question is how community will be facilitated in these stream spaces. Right now comments are associated with entries, but I imagine that associating them with a stream, linked to a particular entry might make more sense. In this way, there's a recognizable difference between the content of the stream and the community that exists around it. Though everyone in the stream is contributing to the stream (I assume the stream as a community feels like a distinct thing. And then there.' s the private stream, just used by someone to cut through the noise and only see what they're interested in seeing. The framework of the stream is the same, the only difference is that it's a community of one. I don't really imagine that there would be a need for more than one or two of these streams per person. The bulk of the potential here is for the community. Definitely starts to suggest some interesting directions for squads and companies or DAOs or what-have-you. 8:50AM / 51F / High of 61F / Foggy](images/05132579/toDPRacYam-daily.webp "")
