![This morning I still have that feeling of having spent perhaps a bit too long in the sun. Yesterday afternoon we went down to the Berkeley Marina and walked out by the bay on the trail there. It was a moment like I wrote about the day before yesterday. The sun w~s low in the sky, and the grass was as green as the sort of green you might imagine grass to be, only more so. The bay was also kind of a caricature of itself, bluer than it exists in your mind. The sun was warm and sat there overlooking the bay for a couple hours. The ground squirrel population out there was a bit out of hand, and quite literally everywhere you looked there was a squirrel. I think they were the native ones, as they had a smaller tail and were pretty low to the ground. Their little squirrel nibbling noises were the backdrop to the afternoon, among with the murmur of distant other walkers, gulls,  and light lapping of waves. I didn't quite get all the way through my list of things to do from yesterday. I finished all the One Dimension related work, so now there's a place to store these  pages once I've finished them. The site also got a little rework so everything's a bit more cohesive. The Hyperfov task needs to be done, so I'm thinking of dedicating a night this week to working on it. Overall I'd like to get the underlying data structure figured out so I can start using it day-to-day. Then It'll be a little clearer what the next priority should be, and I can continue the design work. I’ve been having this experience recently where I have a wave of ideas right as I close my eyes to go to sleep. Last night, for example, I thought of something and made a conscious effort to "bookmark" it for remembering, and of course upon waking up I forgot it. I have been using a little notebook for writing some quick ideas down, which I them return to later as I'm writing my daily note sin One Dimension. I've heard this referred to as a "writing inbox" which I think is quite fitting. Maybe what I need to do is bring this notebook with me to bed so I can jot stuff down. The fear of course is that by indulging my brain with following these thoughts, I'll end up staying up too late. Worth an experiment, though. Today should be a pretty run-of-the-mill sort of day. I have a lot I want to get done both at work and on FL, so it'll be a bit of sticking to the schedule in a militant sort of way. Saving time to stare out the window a bit, of course. 8:10AM / 42F / High of 59F / Clear](images/98344823/KuYtRHEYnj-daily.webp "")
