- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 packet yeast
- 2 tbsp sugar (optional)
- Â¼ cup vegetable oil 
- 1 tsp salt
- 750g flour

Mix the warm water with the yeast and let sit. 

Warm the milk with the sugar until it dissolves. Remove the milk and let cool until lukewarm. 

Mix the milk and yeast water. Add the oil, salt, and flour and mix until a dough forms. Knead a little, then let sit for 1 hour. 

Turn the dough out and roll into to a half-inch thick. Cut into the desired shapes. Place on a baking sheet with wheat bran or cornmeal and let rise for 30 min. 

Heat a skillet over medium. Cook dough pieces for about 8-10 minutes, flipping when golden brown. Cook for another few minutes.
