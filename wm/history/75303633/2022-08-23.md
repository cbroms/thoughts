There seems to be a kind of genre on YouTube of dudes dispensing their perspective on the world while chilling outside.

Some of the best examples: 

- [*A Balanced & Complete Life*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BziToidh7Tw) from Dewayne Noel. 
- [*The meaning of life and stuff*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAFNZDTHDZE) from Rodney Norman. 
- Anything from Stobe the hobo.
