![A bit of an unusual sort of afternoon today. Today was Tuesday, so I went to work in the morning and came back around 5:20 or so. Then we walked down to the garden to plant the tomatoes we'd brought over on Saturday but hadn't yet planted. It was kinda nice being there by ourselves; much calmer feeling. We ended up planting six of the eight tomatoes that we had there, which was more than I'd expected would fit on the little plot. We'll see how they do, I hope we actually are able to grow some tomatoes this year and try canning them. That would be incredible. Anyway, as we were walking over there I mentioned that I kinda felt in the mood for pizza, hinting, I suppose, that we should make some pizza this weekend. Sydney took this much more concretely and insisted that we go out and get some pizza tonight. And so we did. It felt a bit naughty going out on a Tuesday night to eat, especially given that we'd already gone out once this month already. But it was definitely good, I had some fries too just to fully indulge in the whole thing. I do love fries. A bit concerning that it's now Tuesday and I haven't done any work on my 1D experiment. I set a pretty strong goal of having the frontend portion done by the end of the week, but no progress has been made on that goal. And tomorrow we're heading over to my parent's house. So realistically I'll just have Thursday and Friday to work on this. Hmmmâ€¦ 10:35PM / 52F / High of 64F / Sun, some clouds this morning clearing to just a few big puffy clouds in the afternoon. Actually now that I think about it, there was this huge dark storm over to the east as I was driving over the hill into Pleasanton. Looked dark and beautiful.](images/64568648/pnqmpIIeUU-daily.webp "")
