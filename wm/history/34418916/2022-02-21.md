I'm particularly interested in trying out some technologies like:

- [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

Sense a pattern?  

I have not actually developed with any of these decentralization-related projects. I think the challenge is that I don't yet think in their language and therefore don't have ideas for how to build with them. Once I begin to learn the language, ideas manifest in that language.
