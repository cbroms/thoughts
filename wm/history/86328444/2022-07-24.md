Sydney and I are starting to get into fishing. Neither of us  fished before, but we both wanted to give it a try, partly because it seems fun and partly because it helps us be more self-sufficient. 

To start, we're going to target trout in high sierra lakes. Trout seem like a good place to start since they're small and getting to them is part of the fun. Over time I imagine we'll start to go for larger fish, maybe saltwater too. 

Figuring out what sort of gear to get was quite the challenge. There's quite a complicated assortment of different varieties of rods, reels, and lures. Coming in with no prior knowledge, it was difficult to know where to start. I used a combination of fishing videos on [YouTube](youtube.md), random web articles, and reddit to start to learn the terminology and become more familiar with the sport in general. 

Here's where we landed for a the first ultralight high sierra trout fishing kit:

- [St. Croix Triumph Travel Spinning rod](https://stcroixrods.com/products/triumph%C2%AE-travel-spinning-rods-2020), light power, fast action, 6'. 
- [Daiwa Regal LT reel](https://daiwa.us/products/regal-lt), 2500. 
- Panther martin spinners, Rooster tails, Blue Fox spinner, Kastmaster

We'll see how it goes.
