![Today started a bit strange as I woke up pretty late, around 9:30AM. We stayed up really late last night watching a British detective show and just *had* to finish the last episode. So it goes. I spent pretty much the entire afternoon washing the windows. They've been really dirty since we first got here last summer, and I've been wanting to wash them. We finally got some Windex, and then a few weeks went by before today I finally decided it just had to be done, and I did it. The whole thing was quite the process as i had to do each side of all the windows twice since they were so dirty. I took off the screens and wiped out the inside of the frames, which don't appeared to have been cleaned, ever, maybe. Nasty stuff. Now they're nice and clean and ready for another year's worth of dirt or so. Having the glass clear and clean is such a big difference. Suddenly looking out the window is like looking outside, not just the idea of outside. The window fades away and becomes unnoticeable. I should have done this eight months ago. Today was quite a pretty day. Not quite a reverie day, but it had all the characteristics of one. I didn't really sit around and do nothing, so it doesn't count. Super clear blue skies, wind, and pretty cool. Not too dry either. The perfect kind of day to sit around, or to get some outdoors stuff done, as it turned out. Would be a great day to go for a hike too. There was a moment there after I'd cleaned the windows and swept the floors that I sat down at the sofa and looked at the sun streaming through the windows and thought to myself just how clean it all was. A sense of incredible clarity. Back to work tomorrow. February's clicking by pretty damn quick. Just waiting for some rain to balance things out again. 9:50PM / 48F / High of 57F / Clear, nice cumulus clouds later in the day.](images/66507690/xxfoyOqqTK-daily.webp "")
