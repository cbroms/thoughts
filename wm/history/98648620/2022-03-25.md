Sometimes it doesn't take a lot to improve your immediate environment. 

For the last week I've had a little sprig of eucalyptus sitting on top of my computer. It's dried out and I get these little whiffs of eucalyptus as I sit there. Such a small change, and yet such [a great experience](experience-design.md).

Another good one is not using fluorescent ceiling lights. I've always said, if you make me live in a place with nothing but ceiling lights I'll probably kill myself. It's incredibly depressing. When I was in [Omaha](omaha-nebraska.md) there weren't any other lights in my apartment except ceiling lights, so I just never turned on the lights at night (good thing it was summer!) I'd rather sit in the dark than under fluorescent lights at home. 

All that's required is to get some point lights here and there, like a desk lamp or reading lamp. Turn those on and you're good to go. The experience becomes a million times nicer.
