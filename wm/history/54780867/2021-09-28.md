- Add multiple options for when to fetch preview data
  - ~~On page load, fetch all~~
  - ~~Only on link hover~~
  - On first link hover, fetch all
- ~~Cache responses on worker~~
- ~~Make a landing page~~
  - Done, see [previews.hyperfov.com](https://previews.hyperfov.com)
- Support pre-building pages, so content is passed in and not fetched dynamically
  - For internal links
- Investigate dropping Svelte and just using web components
- ~~Passed in styles sometimes don't get adopted?~~
- Some pages are being weird and responding with 525?
- ~~Adjust positions when page is resized~~
  - ~~Might need to investigate a different positioning technique for this~~
  - Done, see my [post on Futureland](https://futureland.tv/christian/entry/108204).
