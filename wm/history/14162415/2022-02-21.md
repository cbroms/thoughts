One of the easiest characterizations you can make about a person is by the car they drive. 

Everyone--no matter what car they drive--fits into a particular bucket. There's the Prius driver. The G Wagon driver. The Tacoma driver. The M3 driver. The Minivan driver. Subaru driver. On and on. No matter what car you drive, it will put you into a bucket. Each particular, with their own identifiable traits. 

The uncomfortable fact about this is that puts me and you and everyone else into a bucket. Every visible choice we make puts us into these buckets. What clothes we wear. What phone we have. Where we live. Where we shop. Etc, etc. 

It's unavoidable. Every choice we make classifies us, stereotypes us.
