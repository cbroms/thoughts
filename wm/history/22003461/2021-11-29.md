Today I went through an old hard drive and organized all the photos I've taken in the last five years or so.

It just made me realize how little I've really made, in the scheme of things. I've only been working in a similar way I do today for the last two years or so, and everything before that feels like I was a kid when I made it.

I've felt like this for long time; every year I look back and see what I've made the years before and felt like I was a totally different person back then. I think it's a good feeling--there's lots to learn and much to improve. 

It's scary to consider one day I might look back at the past few years prior and not see a real change.
