is a bridge in North Carolina that causes quite a bit of issue to truck drivers that don't pay attention to the flashing lights and whatnot. An interesting [psychological](psychology.md) question to consider why this is such a problem. 

There's a [website](http://11foot8.com/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/yovo68/videos) dedicated to the bridge, an incredible little slice of the [internet](the-internet.md).
