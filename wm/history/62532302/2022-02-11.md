One of my favorite things about [California](california.md) is the distinct fragrances you get over the course of the year. 

In the summer--the dry grass and bay trees--different depending on if it's dry or if a bank of fog is blowing in. Little pockets of Eucalyptus too, occasionally mixed in. 

The smell of the Central Valley; sulfur and soil mixed with heat. 

The sierras; cedar, dry, wafts of pine, becoming more nuanced with elevation and the introduction of little crevices of deep moisture and delicate green. Higher still, nothing at all. 

First rain; the dry organics steep and create an exceptionally fragrant tea of grass, bay, pine, eucalyptus. 

Then it's the winter, and everything's soaked. Redwood forests, dripping and mixing a dark depth with crisp highs. Mossy decay. 

Spring starts in February; plum blossoms open and the air fills with an incredibly light floral fragrance. Sun starts to return and dry out the shadows, cool green wet slowly turns to a light dried green, then yellow as heat and fog cycles begin.
