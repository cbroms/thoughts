![I ended up , getting pretty deep into reading about ancient Assyria and Ashurbanipal. I'd heard a podcast about him a while ago (hardcore history on the flight back from Virginia in January, to be exact) and for some reason I found myself thinking about him again today, so I did a Wikipedia deep dive. We used to be so incredibly brutal. Some of the quotes from the Assyrian records are truly fantastic. Cutting off heads, flaying people alive, ripping out tongues, and making rivers run red with the blood of the enemy's corpses. We haven't changed. That's the incredible thing to me; that we are. fundamentally the same creatures that existed back then. The only difference is that the society we inhabit has changed quite a lot, but biologically speaking nothing has really changed. The same psychological mechanisms are still at play. It's why, I think, some of the social aspects of life back then still exist today, despite all the changes. The most Obvious one is marriage: this king who's slaying of his enemies is forever memorialized had wives in much the same way we still do (albeit now one wife, not multiple.) Still, pretty incredible to think about. Something that struck me as I was reading is how familiar the language sounded. One phrase in particular stuck out: "King of the Universe." Evidently Ashurbanipal described himself as the King of the Universe, among many other things. But the word "Universe" feels much too modern. For me at least it has a specific sort of connotation that I can't imagine it had for Ashurbanipal. And yet the translator decided it was the correct word. What, I wonder, was the underlying concept that the translator felt was the same between the ancient Assyrian word and the modern english word? What does Universe represent? I can't even say what it really represents in english, in some sense there's a level of meaning it, or any other word for that matter, captures beyond a simple dictionary definition. There's some underlying concept there, something impossible to actually describe. We just all sort of know it. And yet here a translator chose this specific concept, for some specific word in an unspoken and forgotten language. It's not that I don't trust the translation or anything like that, just more that this thing we do where we take these immaterial concepts and turn them into concrete abstractions is so impressive, especially considering how that process works to turn one re presentation into another. The concepts are what we're really working with, not necessarily the words themselves. 9:30PM / 52F / High of 62F / Clear and sunny](images/99016797/BktzjKYFbk-daily.webp "")
