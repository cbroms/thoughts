I'm building a website composed of nothing but buttons. It shall be called [button.land](https://button.land).

[Collections of things](collections.md) are particularly interesting to me. I like the documentary aspect of it; there's nothing to it beyond what the things themselves are. Nothing clever. Just a bunch of buttons.
