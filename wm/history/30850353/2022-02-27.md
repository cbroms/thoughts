![It's late and I don't have anything I really want to write about. So I'll make this pretty short. Today I started a few new tasks I want to revisit every week on Sunday. In particular, there's a task to input all the week's receipts into our big expense tracking spreadsheet. I do this every month at a higher level, so this is just filling in at a smaller level. Another task I added was a weekly meal plan. We've been trying to be more conscious of our grocery spending, and one thing that's been helpful with that is pre-planning out our meals instead of just sort of showing up at the grocery store, and winging it. So now every Sunday I'll write out the week's meals on a piece of paper and stick it to the fridge. The final new task I added was a button collection task. I'm experimenting with creating a site that documents the internet's buttons, so every week on Sunday I'll transform a button I've found over the week into CSS and add it to the site. We'll see how it goes. 9:10PM / 52F / High of 67F / Clear and sunny](images/30850353/yYGjlowSyl-daily.webp "")
