![Today, Sydney and I went for a walk in the Berkeley hills. We left around 2:00 or so, and the sun was already quite low in the sky. It was quite an unusually dry and breezy day for January and the sky was totally blue. I wrote a note a little while ago called "reverie" or something like that after a Thoreau quote: Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway form sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and the hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sing around flitted noiseless through the house, until the sun falling in at my west window, of the sound of some traveller's wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. The day was very much like that. We sat on some sunny rocks in a meadow listening to the birds, distant chatter, and wind. It was exceptional not because it was totally natural, but rather because it was a kind of mix of natural and not. Everything seemed to exist in a kind of harmony, singing quietly in the warm late afternoon light. In moments like these it's impossible not to feel a sense of deep satisfaction with the particular little place in the world that you occupy. Your mind is occupied by nothing except the murmur of other little beings that surround you. It's a very strong sense of place, Last night we went out to watch the new PT Anderson film Licorice Pizza. I came away from it feeling like the the director clearly had quite a lot of fun making it. Every scene seems a combination of thought out but also existing in a very particular momentary "just-so" sort of thing. As if the particular combination of every ingredient coming together simply WORKED. Hard to describe, but something PT Anderson seems to routinely get right. I look forward to seeing the film again. Well, that's the first daily page on the typewriter. It clearly will take some getting used to, but I think I'm already starting to get the hang of it. I'm really curious what I'll learn from experimenting with it. 9:00PM / 54F / High of 69F / Clear and windy](images/95877263/XkmkdsBKaH-daily.webp)
