I really don't like that whenever I need to do a file conversion, I have to go online and use one of those sketchy sites. 

The alternative of course is to use CLI tools like `ffmpeg` and `imagemagick`. But it takes a while to fiddle around with the parameters to get it to do exactly what I want. And to repeat that same command on different files means changing the filenames in the command and repeating over and over. 

I'd really like a simple GUI wrapper for these CLI conversion tools. Something that would let me interact with them in a more OS-native way, where I could drag and drop or select a folder of images or videos and covert. 

Seems like this would be well suited for a desktop app of some kind. Probably going to have to be electron since this is something I've found myself wanting on MacOS and linux, and I could definitely see being needed on Windows too.
