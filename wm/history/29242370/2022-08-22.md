The goal of Rainflame is to create simple, exceptional digital tools.

Some projects that fall under the Rainflame umbrella: 

- [Visual budgeting software](visual-budgeting-software.md)
- [Simple file conversion](simple-file-conversion.md)

# Origins

Rainflame started in 2019, when I was working on a tool called [v4](https://github.com/cbroms/V4.js) in Omaha Nebraska. I wanted to have some kind of a parent organization for the project, thinking that the tool would be integrated into a larger project I was planning. So I created Rainflame. The name means nothing at all, I just thought it sounded pretty cool. I eventually abandoned v4 but kept the Rainflame domain. 

Now I'm using it again as a parent organization, this time for a series of small tools I'm planning on building. Each tool will have its own branding and unique use cases, but live under the umbrella of the Rainflame toolkit.
