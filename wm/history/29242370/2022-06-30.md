The goal of Rainflame is to create high-quality simple digital tools. 

# Tools 

## RF1 

The first tool, RF1, is for managing stock portfolios, specifically rebalancing. There are no free online tools for rebalancing or determining which assets should be purchased at a buy-in. RF1 will provide these tools for free in a simple, local-first system. 

# Origins

Rainflame started in 2019, when I was working on a tool called [v4](https://github.com/cbroms/V4.js) in Omaha Nebraska. I wanted to have some kind of a parent organization for the project, thinking that the tool would be integrated into a larger project I was planning. So I created Rainflame. The name means nothing at all, I just thought it sounded pretty cool. I eventually abandoned v4 but kept the Rainflame domain. 

Now I'm using it again as a parent organization, this time for a series of small tools I'm planning on building. Each tool will have its own branding and unique use cases, but live under the umbrella of the Rainflame toolkit.
