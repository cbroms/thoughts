It seems like people often undervalue taking a local-first, small-scale approach to problem solving. 

Because of [the internet](the-internet.md) and focus on [global-scale problems](global-impact.md), we forget what's really important. What's around us is important--the immediate context is what drives our day-to-day. 

Starting small--perhaps very small--accomplishes two primary goals:

1. It gives you a concrete starting place. A small goal is easier to finish than a larger one. One win can begin the cycle of more and more wins over time, progressively larger and more complex. 
2. It puts the fruits of your labor before you in a tangible way. It builds confidence and competence when you can better see and feel what you're doing and how to improve. These are problems that also often require less overhead {structure} to approach.
