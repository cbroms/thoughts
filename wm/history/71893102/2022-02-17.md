David Lynch is right about that. I hate loosing ideas. 

There have been a few instances recently where I’ve been thinking about something right before I go to sleep or start some other task. I’ll make a conscious effort to sort of “bookmark” the thought, but often when I come back later it’s gone.

It’s a bit like I’m kayaking at sea, and I’m about to wash up on a beach. So I tie the kayak to some rocks, then dismount and wade ashore. When I come back later, the kayak is gone and all that remains are the rocks that I remember tying it to, along with a bit of rope. 

You recognize that you lost it, that's the worst part. It was right there, now it's gone forever. 

So I try to [write ideas down](writing-inbox.md) as soon as they come to me.
