I love oranges. 

There's just something about that citrusy, tart-but-sweet sort of thing that's *perfect*. And when you find just the right orange... "divine" is normally reserved as an ironic word, but can most certainly be used unironically here. 

I have this vision of oranges in the desert. Mid-century modern architecture; Phoenix, Arizona; winter. Green lawns and orange trees.
