The goal of this experiment is to explore the feeling of interfaces. 

The way the interface responds to interaction is such a subtle thing, something that we usually don't think about but still do notice. It often manifests in the feeling of an interface being "slow." 

My thought is to present an interface that's laggy, and then break out each of the interactions of interest. You'll be able to play around with the amount of lag in each, and vote on the threshold at which the lag becomes noticeable. Then, you'll be able to choose from a couple different fixes to the issue. As you do so, you'll see what others picked, which will gradually build up a decision tree much like you see in games like *Detroit: Become Human*.
