I've spent the last eight months living completely surrounded by small dogs. My feelings on the matter have a decided lack of nuance. 

Every neighbor around us has a small dog of some denomination. And they all bark exceptionally aggressively. Every time we walk by. Or anyone walks by. Or they *imagine* someone walks by.

Is there anyone in Berkeley that doesn't have a small dog?

I was once walking out our gate and the neighbors dog ran up to me barking and growling. No problem, this dog is tiny; I give it the benefit of the doubt. So this little cunt bites me! Doesn't even break the skin it's such a bitch. 

The next time that little satanic sperm ran up to me I started shooing it away with my foot until its owner came over and dragged it away. I swear to God the next time it bites me I will fucking punt it across the street like a football. 

Who thinks these things are cute? They're awful, humanity should be ashamed that we created them. I'm of the opinion we need to have a small dog "solution." Stop breeding these things. Stop buying them. Let them die and never be replaced.
