![This evening we went over to the community garden to figure out the trellis situation for the tomatoes, and plant some of the seedlings we got at Annies last weekend. I'm not a big fan of the community garden. I don't feel like the plot of land we have is really ours, in some sense it's like renting. At some point we're going to leave and give it up, which limits what we can do with it. But our garden at home is also on rented land, so what's so different about this? Part of it seems like it's something to do with the fact that the garden has a bunch of people that know how to garden, and previously gardened this plot of land. So we're being judged, especially given that everyone at the garden has their own little plot that's easy to compare against its neighbor. Not so at home. There's no expectation that we have a garden, so the fact we do isn't really something that's required. Nobody's out there comparing it to anything else, it just sort of is what it is. I like that. Land ownership seems important. It's what makes you feel like your work is your own. At the garden I feel like I'm sort of a caretaker of this little plot, being judged for my caretaking abilities. I feel like when I see someone's 'neglected front yard I'm not really comparing them to anyone else; it's their yard and they can do what they want. But when you see someone with a really nice front garden, you appreciate that. Just appreciation. And they can feel like they’re creating something over a longer timescale, because they own it. I don't know, maybe I'm totally wrong about all this stuff. Perhaps. All I do know is that I don't really like the:feeling of gardening in this borrowed space, just feels unfortunate. 8:30PM / ·63F / High of 74F / Clear and sunny](images/77439411/NbVCQtQpML-daily.webp "")
