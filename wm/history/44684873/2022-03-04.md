![One of the main issues people often seem to have with software is something hard to define, something somewhat subjective. It’s the feeling of the software. The *feeling.* Every time you interact with something, it leaves an impression in your mind. That impression is partially functional, sure, but it's also composed of the more emotional aspect of the experience. What was it like to interact with the software? It's such a hard thing to talk about. But I think it's key to the practice of designing these systems. This isn't just what colors you use, or what typeface. It's beyond pure style. They contribute, sure, but this is more elemental. It manifests through the structure, and through the interaction. It's something that I don't think was well defined or taught when I went to school, it seems like most of the focus is on the better defined aspects of the practice of interface design and UX. The *feeling* of the software. This is something worth exploring I think. I went to the grocery store this afternoon and purchased a chunk of cheese for $5.67. It's some sort of aged white cheddar imported from England. Why would I buy such a thing? It's perhaps the definition of extraneous. But I shaved off a bit to taste, and wow it is incredible. Sweet, salty, with such a tart, pleasant flavor. How can things taste this good? I feel the same way with chocolate sometimes too. You taste it, and it's like there's absolutely nothing better to eat in the world. It's something I've been thinking more about lately. I really enjoy most aspects of frugality and living as simply as possible, but at the same time there are areas where spending a bit of extra money creates an experience that's just so much better. It's not just nice tasting thing, it's also buying foods that are more ethically produced, or perhaps more local or grown at a smaller scale and whatnot. There seems very much to be some value to me in spending the extra money to buy these sorts of things. People on forums that discuss all the ways to live more frugally seem to overlook this, or simply not care very much about it. Their priorities are much more on the frugality at all costs, rather than a bit more of a balance. Maybe that'll mean that I will work longer before having some amount of financial freedom, but so be it if I get to eat things that make me much more content in the day-to-day. Or so I think now. BALANCE. 8:20PM / 48F / High of 61F / Cloudy and cool this morning, clearing and very windy this afternoon.](images/44684873/XblIJTnBNq-daily.webp "")
