![The last couple nights I've been working a bit on Hyperfov again. Instead of only focusing on the browser-history portion of it I've been going back and rewriting the link preview package I made last fall. It was a bit hacky when I first put it together, but I am still of the opinion that it'd be a useful thing to have. So I'm rewriting it to be beautiful and clean, something that could be added to any page without reservation. So I'm rewriting it to use Web Components and mirror the tippy.js API where you pass in the element you want the preview attached to. The styling and markup can be decided by the end user, since they'll be able to define the1r own template with slots for the component to pull from. I also threw together a quick landing page for Hyperfov. As part of that endeavor, I needed to come up with a nice and pithy one line summary of the project. I tried a few things before realizing that I had the perfect tool for the job: the typewriter. I sat down and started writing and came up with maybe 25 different sentences before one in particular spoke to me and seemed to say the right things. I ended up with: "Hyperfov is a new set of tools for traversing the web." Pretty simple and not particularly inventive, but I think it describes it in the correct language and tone. The typewriter was perfect for coming up with a million different iterations on the sentence until the words I'd written down just happened to be exactly as they should be. People talk about machine learning systems like GPT-3 being the future of writing and creativity in general. It seems to me that the underlying need there is to have an external source to introduce ideas you hadn't thought of before, and o help you get out of a kind of creative rut. The need for machine learning systems for this task, I'm finding, is perhaps unnecessary. The typewriter suggests that there are alternative ways, perhaps manual, that could be designed to serve the same task. Maybe the best have yet to be designed or stumbled upon;I look forward to stumbling on some myself. Hopefully tools like Hyperfov can serve as the backbone for a new sort of exploratory creative practice that uses the same infrastructure—the internet in Hyperfov's case—in order to produce a very different experience of that infrastructure than is conventionally available. 8:10AM / 43F / High of 62F / Clear](images/85711229/mCORAHcxcF-daily.webp "")
