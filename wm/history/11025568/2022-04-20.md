![This evening I'm at my parent's house. We're staying over for the rest of the week and the weekend while they go down to pick up their new camper. This is the first time I've ever written on this typewriter outside of our house. This afternoon I packed it up in its case and stuck it in the car. Felt kinda cool somehow, lugging this big heavy piece of machinery with me someplace. It being a tool is incredibly apparent, it's a bit like if I were to take my shovel with me to a new place I was doing some work, or a saw. But this is a machine for writing; it's a tool for thinking, as dumb as that sounds. There's something kinda nice about that thought, having machines for different set purposes. Like if I'll be going on a trip and know that I'll want to be doing some writing, I bring the typewriter. If I'm going to be doing some coding, I bring the programming machine. Drawing, a sketchbook. In being something that's for a specific task, the machine becomes mare focused and opens up more potential for the machine to be a transformative part of the creation experience. I'd not really consider many text editors to be transformative tools for writing or even coding, but I would consider a typewriter to be a transformative tool for writing. Even now, the last paragraph I've just written I've only just thought about as I was writing it. The tool allowed me to think in such a way as to continue down this line of thought. The permanence of the words on the paper forced me to continue with it, to take it to its conclusion. I'd have otherwise stopped writing a while ago, finding that the thought was too scatterbrained and needed more time for consideration before being committed to digital permanence. Not so here. I feel like I've written something to that effect probably five or six times over now that I've started writing on this thing everyday. It's true though. The repetition is evidence of that. Today it started raining as we were driving over the Richmond bridge. There was this opening in the clouds illuminating it while the surrounding water was dark, and the hills in marin were obscured by the characteristic look of rainfall in the distance. Sure enough, as we drove into marin it started falling. And tonight as we were eating dinner it rained quite a lot, serious rain. The rain gauge said 0.35 inches last I checked. Not much, but significant seeing as it's the end of April now and we barely got any rain at all this spring. Exciting. 10:15PM / 55F / High of 59F / Sunny with some low clouds, getting darker as the day went on, rain this evening.](images/11025568/euxLNvllNu-daily.webp "")
