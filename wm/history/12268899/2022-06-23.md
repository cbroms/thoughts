Some things I've been listening to recently: 

- Lots of music. I keep [a log of what I find to be the best song of the day](https://futureland.tv/christian/best-song-of-the-day/grid). It's generally lots of different kinds of metal, psychedelic rock, indie stuff, folk, and a bit of electronic vaporwave sort of stuff. 
    - Deafheaven. An absolutely phenomenal band that has created some of the [most emotionally charged](the-most-poignant-song.md) songs Iâ€™ve [heard](infinite-granite-live.md).
    - Toro y Moi. Discovered this guy from my high school photography teacher who played [a music video of his](https://youtu.be/gGmfOsdla2Y) once during class. When I got home I totally forgot the name of the artist and tried searching for keywords from the video until I finally found it (guy casually pulling aside fern frond music video?)
    - The War on Drugs. Consistently incredible. So many of their tracks are associated with [particular places](music-and-places.md) for me. 
- The [Lex Fridman Podcast](lex-fridman.md). I listen to this when I commute to work. A wide range of guests engaging in quite compelling discussions with a most excellent host.
