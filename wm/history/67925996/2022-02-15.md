![It seems like I've been procrastinating getting started on Hyperfov for a while now. I've recently been working on the link previews package, which, although related, is not the bulk of the project. But I have certainly been working on it, just not in an explicit way. I've been thinking through what the experience of using it could be like, and all the possible permutations depending on how the thing is built and structured. The challenge is of course that there aren't any real relatively similar systems like Hyperfov. This isn't just an ordinary website, and will as a result require a totally custom architecture that I'll have to fully think through and commit to. That's challenging because the system's design will have a big impact on the user experience; this isn't just something that can be abstracted behind an API layer and never seen by the user. No, this will be something that might be installed locally and as a result has to make sense in the context of both the browser and the operating system. That's a pretty unique problem that I haven't seen solved by anything before. So as I'm thinking through all the possible ways the system could be architected, I'm considering what it would be like as the user interacting with it. The next challenge is of course that there aren't any real constraints yet. This means that what the system actually is isn't entirely clear. I have a somewhat vague sense for what it should do, but there aren't any constraints to anchor that in something concrete. So I think the most useful next step for me to do at this point is to set some constraints, as I would any other job I work on. In order to figure out those requirements, I think I'll first do some design explorations and mock up some hypothetical workflows. It's sort of like you are one of those early frontiersmen who come upon a place you want to build a town. So they have to figure out how the town is organized. Except in their case they have the benefit of knowing both what features they want their town to have (saloon, hotel, general store… ) as well as the physical geography of the place that adds constraints to where things can be places (hills, forests, water sources…) So the real challenge right now is figuring out both of those two sets. of constraints. What are the features we want, and what are the physical challenges that inform how the software should be structured? 8:50AM / 48F / High of 62F / Sunny and clear](images/67925996/QbIIoqWinq-daily.webp "")
