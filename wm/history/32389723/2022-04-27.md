![It's pretty strange designing interfaces sometimes. It's like you're just going along, messing with different components and reconfiguring them this way and that way, and then it suddenly all fits together. When it's working, it's incredibly clear. You don't really have to think about it. It just works. It's as though there's a curve, and you're sort of exploring the curve, getting closer to the correct answer, but not quite. And then BOOM, you hit the spike in the curve that takes you to the maxima. For whatever reason, the last couple weeks have been a lot of fun designing interfaces. I design a lot of interfaces, but there's something about the little groove I've been in that’s felt especially good. When I've been stuck it hasn't been for long; I'll fairly work out the correct answer for the given problem. And then I just sort of keep cruising through it. Maybe it's improvement? I was just thinking to myself the other day that I don't really have a great heuristic for determining if my actual design skills are improving. At work it seems like the main focus for improvement is more interpersonal and personal in a sort of responsibility kinda way. But there's no mention of improvement to actual design skills. It feels like improvement is mostly about getting to the optimal design in as optimal a way as possible. You start to develop a bunch of patterns and boxes of related approaches to similar problems in your mind, and they can be applied to any new problem you encounter. I can see how this would of course result in interfaces that are more usable, but also interfaces that are more familiar or derivative. Though to be honest my feeling on this recently has mostly been that interfaces and systems more broadly are so poorly designed that usability should really be prioritized above inventiveness, I'd take a usable interface that's derivative over an impossibly complex one that’s unique any time. Though I feel like my view on this is likely to change in the future. 10:40PM / 5OF / High of 67F / Partly cloudy, mostly high clouds](images/32389723/dTuxnKXJde-daily.webp "")
