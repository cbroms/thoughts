I'd like to figure out how to build a system that serves two primary purposes: 

- Link to specific parts of a constantly changing webpage. For example, I might want to link to the text "I'd like to figure out how to build a system" above, but if I were the author of the page and I changed the word *build* to *design*, still preserve the link. 
- Capture the way the content on a page changes and move through the history of a given page. As in the previous example, I'd like to be able to see where the edits to text have been made. It's a bit different than a full-on page archive and moving back in time, I'm specifically interested in seeing old text next to newer text. Like looking at a git diff.
