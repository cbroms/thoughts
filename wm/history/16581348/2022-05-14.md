Today we started off the day by going around Berkeley and picking up little gifts for Sydney's mom. We started by going over to a coffee place, then we went over to Elmwood to this chocolate place that turned out to be closed. So while we waited for it to open, we sat in the car and read *Animal Farm* aloud to each other. It was pretty nice--a great book to read out loud. 

Then we got these fancy little chocolates for both of our moms, then went to this fancy tea store and got some fancy tea for Sydney's mom. 

After that we drove over to Marin and picked up some lunch at Mi Familia. We had lunch with my mom and then I helped load up the dumpster they'd ordered to start cleaning stuff out of the garage. Quite a chore. We moved Mother's day to tomorrow so my brother could be there, so this was my mother's day gift.
