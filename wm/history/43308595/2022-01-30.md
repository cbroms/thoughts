As we were driving over the bay bridge today, I saw a motorcycle with a bike on it. 

I can say with some confidence that I've never seen a motorcycle with a bike on it. I realized that as soon as I'd seen it. 

That's pretty rare; seeing something for the first time. It feels like so much of what we see is permutations of the familiar, and here was something totally fresh. An unusual sensation.
