![Well, the morning has finally come where I have nothing in particular to write about. I mean I do have plenty that I *could* write about, I just don't feel like it. So I guess I'll think a bit about my projects, as there's always something there to write about. I spent the evening last night working on Hyperfov at a sort of concept level. I took some websites and brought them into Figma, then listed beside them all the attributes that could be used to classify them. There were some obvious ones, like content-based tags, and then there were some more interesting ones, like page color, style, or layout I guess these could be considered more subjective, but all of this stuff is pretty subjective. For the most part, the exercise wasn't as constructive as I'd hoped. It made me realize that a bit part of what properties that should be lifted from the page for search should be based on the sort of properties that people would most likely remember later. I don't have a great sense for if people remember a page by its content or by its appearance. I’m sure it's slightly different for everyone. But the point is that I need a bit more information to make more informed choices about the design. One alternative possibility I considered was making the system classify sites across a wide range of different properties, and then through actual use figuring out what exactly  people use to search. Might require a bit more up front effort, but would mean tan the process of narrowing it down later is much faster since everything’s already been built. The other thing I experimented with last night is this vision I've been having in my mind of a layer below a website. It's like you hit a button, and suddenly the website drops down and reveals a space below. In this space you can see the pages that link to the site, the pages it links to, and all sorts of other meta information. There's also the possibility of a social layer beneath it too; conversation is happening. So you're having your own experience of a site, then you're curious about other's response to it. So you open up the site to reveal the discussion below. This image has come to me so many times that I feel there's something about it I must pursue. Maybe you could classify all these related sorts of ideas as a new layer to the internet. Rather than just pages as they're presented, this new layer is for anyone to discuss those pages, to connect them to others. Yeah, this is another idea that fits. The idea that anyone should be able to create links between sties, not just the authors. I've been thinking about that one for a while but hadn't connected it to this project. Need to think more about it, hmmmm… 9:00AM / 55F / High of 67F / Sunny and clear](images/63236489/ehDYGyEwza-daily.webp "")
