I must admit that I do like a good rant. Who doesn't? 

Perhaps the most relevant rant to this site is a classic by Donald Brook, entitled *[Why I Fucking Hate Weblogs](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/bones/WhyIHateWebLogs.html)*:

> Weblogs suck ass. What the fuck is up with this shit? Fuck. Who the fuck cares what these people think about oatmeal or what the UN did last week? Nobody! Who reads these weblogs? Nobody! Maybe fellow weblog authors read each others weblogs out of a sense of desperation...the feeling that if they read someone else's weblog, someone will read theirs. It's kindof like cooperative advertising too, people will cross-post, linking weblog entries to each other's weblogs. How fucking pathetic is that? I hate weblogs. There are so few reasons to keep a weblog, and so many of these are fucking stupid while so few of them are legitimately non-brainfucked. The problem of course, is people. In general, people are fucking stupid, so many of the things they do are fucking stupid. I fucking hate weblogs, they are so fucking stupid. 

I came across [another particularly masterfully-written rant](https://im1776.com/2021/02/12/land-of-the-free/) today. A few choice excerpts:

> If we let bureaucrats achieve their dreams of a universal homogenous state, we won’t find the people reflecting on the arguments of Hegel and Kojève, they’ll be watching reruns of the Kardashians whilst doped up on heavily-taxed Benzos. Wait, is that now? But in the near future, thanks to the genius of the technology industry, those Benzos will be bought with Yang-approved UBI crypto tokens and delivered by a Silicon Valley-funded blockchain start-up made of former Obama interns.

> In twelve years, when Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decide who enters their Girlboss-branded ark to cross the floods of climate change, I will stand in front of their clipboards and say, “Look Ladies, I’m a nice person, honest. I mostly recycle and only went to that one Trump fundraiser, a weak-willed person who saw life as performance art.” 

> Instead of responding with the only appropriate action — laughing at it all, we take to Twitter to cry out in dismay, our lack of impact negated by the carefully designed dopamine reward of retweets and likes. The digital public square controls the narratives of our collective activist fantasia, that a 280 character sentence or consumer purchase could be an act of moral virtue. One night last year I found myself buying six pairs of Biden-Harris campaign socks online. Alexa, how does one assimilate oneself into the Cathedral? 

I don't know, there's something really satisfying hearing somebody absolutely lay into something they disagree with. Obviously it's not meant to appeal to one's {reason}, it's meant to make an emotional appeal--something deep and compelling.
