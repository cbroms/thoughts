My partner and I decided that it'd be good to distill some of our principles for living into a set of commandments, print them out, and attach them to the wall. Perhaps there's some wisdom to the way more religious families tend to do the same and turn abstract principles to a set of codified rules for living in their homes. 

Here's the current state of the list: 

- Appreciate this day.
- Thank what brings you life.
- Attend to what is around you.
- Do what you need to do.
- In others, find yourself.
- Mutually cherish what is between you.
- Dedicate a time of [each day to reflection](reflection.md). 
- Dedicate a day of each week to reflection.
