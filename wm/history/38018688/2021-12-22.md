As I've been getting into investing recently, I've been thinking a lot about a particular aspect of it--the notion that the stock market always goes up.

Looking at the entire history of the stock market, it's clear that this assumption is fairly well-founded. Things _have_ always gone up--companies create value and shares in those companies go up in value. The United States, as a whole, has one of the largest and most advanced economies in the world. Investing, it is said, is a way to benefit off that advancement.

Indeed, as long as the economy exists in its current state, investing in it makes sense. If [significant changes](a-societal-precipice.md) were to occur, though, who knows. Progress, in the sense we've _progressed_ over the last 200 years or so, is a bit new. Especially the exponential progress as of late. Will things always continue in this way?

Maybe it makes sense to think about investing as a kind of trust you have that the U.S. economy will continue to grow and create value through technological progress.

At the moment, I have quite a bit of trust that progress will continue, for better or worse.
