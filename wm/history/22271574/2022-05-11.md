- 2 cups flour
- ¼ tsp salt
- ½ tsp baking powder
- ¼ cup butter 
- ⅔ cup warm water

Break up the butter into the dry ingredients until it's like sand. Add the water and mix, then knead a few times until it comes together. Cut into 8-12 pieces and let rest covered for 30 minutes or so. 

Roll out each piece and fry it in a dry pan on medium-ish heat. Flip over after 45 seconds or so, then fry for another 20 seconds.
