There's something sublime about taking a bite out of a fruit that's just the right ripeness, with just the right balance of flavors. It's a rare thing, to find a fruit with just these right qualities.

I tend to find this is most likely to happen with: 

- Berries. Usually when they're picked right off the bush and are warm from the sun. 
- [Oranges](oranges.md). When you get that first orange in the winter, it's just incredible. 
- Apples. Probably 90% of apples don't have this quality. But when you find one of the rare 10%, it's phenomenal. 
- Pears. About the same ratio as apples.
