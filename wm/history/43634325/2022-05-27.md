The goal of One Dimension Experiments is to develop a series of experimental tools, interactions, inquiries, and in-depth explorations into anything, really. 

The key unifying force is that each is rich with interactivity that elevates ideas from a purely text-based existence. The page couldn't just be printed out and read, it must be interacted with. 

I'm particularly inspired by a [GPS article](gps-article.md) I read, which presents information in this incredibly simple and interactive way. The article isn't read, it's experienced.

They're also about finding ways to get around the whole "I'm a serious author, [you should listen to me](the-authority-of-writing.md)" thing. Something I think could be interesting would be to basically come to a series of conclusions with the help of the audience; trying to blur the line between author and audience. Sort of like in those narrative games like _Detroit: Become Human_, where you can see how many of each player chose each of the dialogue options, except baked into the interactive examples.

Here's all the experiments I've made and am working on: 

- [Experiment: categorical color palette generation](experiment-categorical-color-palette-generation.md)
- [Experiment: feeling of interfaces](experiment-feeling-of-interfaces.md)
