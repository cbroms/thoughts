Here are some of my predispositions. 

I am a [pragmatist](pragmatism.md). I tend to be a bit contrarian. I tend towards libertarian (sometimes strongly so) on the libertarian/authoritarian spectrum. I tend to be somewhat conservative in my action. 

According to the dark magic of personality tests, I am INTJ.
