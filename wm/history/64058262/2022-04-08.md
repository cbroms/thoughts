![I feel like a lot of the progress in the digital apace in the last however many years has sort of made it more difficult to distinguish between trends and actual progress. Trends, it seems, are very much ephemeral, moments in time where there's *a thing to do* and everyone's doing it. Or talking about it at least. Actual changes to the world don't just sort of fade away, there's a bit more permanence to them, if you could even consider it that. A longer timescale, just slightly, in the scheme of things. The challenge is that so much of the stuff that's actually changing the world in a noticeable way *seems* just as small a change as some of the trends. Everything starts with the same sort of hopeful kind of attitude, the old meme that everything is going to change the world applies here. â€œThis will change the world" they all say. Sure, okay. And then something random actually does. For example, Uber seemed like a pretty small sort of change. As a service, it's pretty fantastic, a perfect sort of example of service design working out. It's just an app though, and apps are often trends. But not this time, now it's changed the world by introducing the gig economy, for better or worse. Compare it to something like crypto which as promised, is supposed to be changing the world. There's a lot promised there. And yet, has anything really changed, other than some people getting scammed and some shitty anime porn and memes getting "sold" as NFTs? Is it really just a trend? I'm starting to think so. I guess the point is that it's really tricky to figure out what's a trend while you're in it. Now that everything's marketed as "world changing" pulling apart what is versus what is not is tough to do. The only proven way to do it is just waiting. 8:40PM / 63F / High of 80F / Some high clouds and sun](images/64058262/ADrKoNhQAR-daily.webp "")
