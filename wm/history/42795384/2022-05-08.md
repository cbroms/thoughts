![Today's errands felt incredibly optimal. The route, that is.We started out by driving up to Annie's in Richmond, and got some more natives and vegetables. It was Mother's day, so of course there were about a million people there. I don't think I've ever seen so many. Anyway, we ended up with some bush beans, pole beans, a Serrano pepper, and some napa cabbage. And a whole bunch of natives. After that we drove back down into El Cerrito and got off at American Soil. We picked up five bags of vegetable soil, which barely fit into the car. This stuff is incredible. It's basically black, and super dense and full of incredible smelling organic things. I put a couple of bags into our raised vegetable beds, hopefully it will solve the problem of all the things we put into them becoming immediately stunted. The next stop was Costco, which was right across the freeway. Costco is incredible. Every time I go there's just so many incredible 1things to see. With incredibly fair prices. I feel like maybe I should invest in Costco… The last stop was over at the community garden, where we finally dropped off the stakes for the tomatoes. I hadn't seen the tomatoes in three weeks or so-- they looked great. Definitely doubled in size at least. The remainder of the afternoon was spent gardening. Actually first we vent to the grocery store, then we gardened. We got the natives in, added the new soil to the raised beds, and I made a hugelkultur mount sort of thing out of some chunks of wood I found sitting around the yard. We'll see how it works, I think it would be cool if it turned out to be the most productive part of the yard. There’s something about it that just seems right. 9:00PM / 52F / High of 61F / Big puffy clouds all day, very windy in a nice way](images/42795384/FVoZOTPGJD-daily.webp "")
