![For whatever reason, time seems to be going 2X as fast the last few weeks. I don't know what it is, but i really don't seem to have enough time to get to everything I want to. I've written about it before, but the giant 8-hour chunk of the day is a pretty big issue. Granted, I'm being paid for those eight hours of time, but it still feels like I'm not getting the best deal. I just need more time! I wish it were the case that I could be done with those eight hours and immediately switch over to my own work for the next five hours. That happened yesterday and it was incredible. But sadly that's not often the case. And it means that tonight I was too drained to do anything. I need to figure this shit out. 9:35PM / 58F / High of 75F / Clear, sunny, and breezy](images/80288138/qOMdPiMIrd-daily.webp "")
