It seems like [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) as a sort of framework might be a good way to dig ourselves out of this {modern web} javascript bloat situation. 

The basic webpage should load and function in the most basic way without javascript. For fancier sorts of interactions, javascript files are loaded in and run as-needed. 

I wonder what sort of [websites](websites.md) this would work for.
