There's a particular time of the year that I first notice fall. It's usually around the end of September, and I'll notice the sun  low in the sky around the middle of the day. 

It's a very nice feeling. September is usually the time when I'm especially tired of summer and its endless heat, and am ready for a change. And so the realization is even more welcome.
