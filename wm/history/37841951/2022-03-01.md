![Sometimes I think I let negativity get the better of me. It is, in my opinion, all too common for me and others to become mired in feelings of displeasure at the world. I try to prevent it, but it still sometimes comes through. My daily page yesterday was a pretty good example of that. I was all angsty about news and people getting caught up in emotions and good and evil and all the rest. Who cares? I don't know why I expend so much mental energy lamenting what is there rather than considering the future and what the future should look like, The trouble is, the future requires the past, and the present. In order to figure out what should be built, it's important to know what doesn't work. And so one feels a need to critique. I feel a need to critique; I shouldn't let myself out of this one by saying "one." This is a tough thing to balance. Good, clean, focused critique is important. Rambling, ranty critique is not. Or perhaps best yet, just don't critique so much! I want to build cool stuff. I keep forgetting that. I want to make things that fit naturally into the opening that the world makes for it, the space formed by all the constraints and the problems faced. I just don't know yet how to prevent myself from getting carried away by the negativity of things. My answer thus far has just been optimism through faith. Yes, yes, the world is shit over there, but the future will be interesting, something that doesn't just follow suit. What a hollow response! Just having faith won't do anything, something more is needed. Something that actually answers the open questions of today while painting a particular future at the same time. My peers and I, it seems, have been placed in a situation where the established ways of doing things are painted as these absolute, true things. No different than any other generation. The unique piece is, though, that the established way of doing things is really just a bunch of bullshit dreamed up in the last 25 years or so. And so when people figure that out, they either get depressed, or just accept it for what it is, and meme it out of existence. Memeing it out of existence, by the way, does not solve the problem. At least it's something. Anyway, the point being that the world we exist in is like one of those McMansions in suburbia; 1/4‚Äù of facade over a bunch of cheap plywood. Made to look real, but really a sort of manufactured bleh. And there I go again. This is hard! 8:50PM / 54F / High of 68F / Some high clouds](images/37841951/uZnadtcdlR-daily.webp "")
