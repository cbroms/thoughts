![A while ago I read an essay about why the U.S. was so advantaged by its geography. Looking at recent events elsewhere in the world, that becomes even clearer. I mean just look at those oceans! Anyone who'd want to attack would need to cross a lot of water, and bring a lot of supplies with them. An invasion from the north isn't really much of a concern because, well, it's the north. And the southern border is pretty slim. All in all, if you're going to launch an invasion of a country, the United States is probably one of the last you'd pick, purely geographically speaking. This article also went through how the geography of the country contributed to its early development. How the Appalachians were a natural protector from western attacks, and how the Atlantic plain allowed for better communication and transport between the early states. Then, there was the westward expansion into the Mississippi valley that was so vital to the next stage of growth; the river enabled the products of this area to be very quickly transported out, and the intracoastal waterway along the Atlantic coast allowed the same barged that brought goods down the river to continue around Florida and north up the coast. This meant that instead of shipping all the product of this region—of which there were many compared to the rest of the country at the time—over the mountains, lots more could be shipped at once relatively cheaply and quickly by river and waterway. I'd never heard of this before, but the essay's hypothesis was basically that this geographic advantage allowed the country to flourish economically very early on. After that, of course, came the further westward expansion and the advent of the railroads. Once the country was linked from coast to coast, the empire was cemented. The United States, having a comparably limited military, could now become a viable superpower. And so it did. All this goes to show how lucky the U.S. was, especially in comparison to so many other countries around the world. Often it seems the situation is such that the powers of the world are limited by their geography, and as a result become embroiled in wars with their neighbors that would otherwise be avoided if the countries were simply a bit further apart. Looking at the maps of the way Russia invaded Ukraine from multiple directions, I get a sense of familiarity with the many, many other maps showing the multi-pronged attacks other countries and armies have carried out in history. Land borders are great when you can drive right over them. I guess it's all just a big roll of the dice, man. 9:00AM / 47F / High of 6OF / Sunny and clear](images/95240863/WvHtxUAJJu-daily.webp "")
