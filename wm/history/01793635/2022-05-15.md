![Made some scones with the family this morning. Then had a nice sit out in the cherry trees for a bit. Then we left around 12:30 and drove back to Berkeley. Did some cleanup, planned out this week's meals, then went to the Grocery store. I then worked for a bit on my color palette project, we made dinner, then Sydney played Dota and I watched the YouTube boxing thing. Iâ€™ve never watched boxing before, but considering I watch some of these guys' videos, I thought I'd give it a try. This is  the YouTube boxing event that iDubbz put on, by the way. Anyway, I found the whole thing incredibly entertaining. Boxing is crazy man. Super tense if the guys are well-matched. I can see why people like it. It's like the perfect amount of time too, each fight isn't too short or long, and there are pauses in between each round for a little tension-building moment. Or releasing. It's also incredible to see how these guys get totally depleted over time. The first rounds are totally different than the last. It's clearly also a lot about endurance, even if you aren't as strong. I guess I really wasn't exposed to these aggressive sports too much. Martial arts and whatnot. There's something about it that feels really essential, a couple of guys beating the shit out of each other. But there's clearly a lot of different technique and layers to the whole thing. 10:00PM / 55F / High of 72F / Sunny, some high clouds, nice fog bank in the distance](images/01793635/umchwATLuJ-daily.webp "")
