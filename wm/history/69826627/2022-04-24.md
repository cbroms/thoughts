![Back at home at last. It was kinda cool carrying around my typewriter in its case, I felt like some sort of CIA agent. Especially because I had a manilla envelope underneath, was like I was carrying a dossier hidden underneath a typewriter. Hah. Today I got a new credit card. It's an American Express card that gives 6% cash back at grocery stores, and 3% cash back at gas stations. Then I have my normal card that gives 2% cash back everywhere, which is pretty nice. I feel like such a normie caring about this sort of stuff. I mean credit cards are so lame anyway. I used to be adamantly against having a credit card, the thing just sort of felt like a giant scam. And it is, it's just that if you're the kind of person to only buy with money you already have, then a credit card is a pretty decent sort of product in that it gives you money back on each purchase that you wouldn't get without one. But if you mess up or ate the sort of person with poor financial awareness, then these things seem like they'd be incredibly dangerous. No wonder credit card debt is such a big thing. But I figure hey, I'm not one Of those people, so might as well take advantage of some of these options. But it still feels lame to go onto these websites and sift through credit cards of all things. I mean that's just so damn… nasty. This afternoon I took advantage of the fact I was at my parents and had access to so many tools to build some stakes for the tomato plants. It's something I've been meaning to do, and I'm glad I was able to come up with a solution that required ;spending absolutely no money whatsoever. I took a bunch of old redwood 2x4s and ripped them down on the table saw to get something closer to a 2x2, then cut them to a consistent length, and then cut a slice out of the end to make an angle that could be pounded into the ground. I think I'll get some twine and make a little tripod above each plant, with the twine wrapped around to provide support all the way up. We'll see how they work out. 9:25PM / 56F / High of 69F / Sunny, some high clouds](images/69826627/JlfxnEvTmP-daily.webp "")
