There's a recurring moment I experience when looking at the sun dipping into the horizon. When the sun sits at your level, something special happens. 

It's no longer possible to pit yourself against the natural world, against the way things are. It's no longer just you and your concerns. 

No, the world has put you level with *it*. For just a few minutes, you and the world are the same; it's made impossible not to see it. Of course you're always [the same as the world](who-are-we.md), but there's just two short moments a day where the world gives you the opportunity to see that in complete detail. It's impossible to miss.
