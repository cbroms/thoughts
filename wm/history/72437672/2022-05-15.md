The goal of this experiment is to figure out how to create the most different-looking set of colors for a visualization. 

There's a bit about this around the web, but I'm unimpressed by the solutions out there. I'd like a few different constraints: 

- 8-20 colors (though could be more, I suppose)
- A parameterized range of lightnesses (not too dark)
- Colorblind friendly 

I've narrowed it down to the [OKLAB color space](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/), which seems to do a better job of mapping out the perceptual space than CIELAB. 

The idea is to choose a constant chroma and a range of lightness (L*). Then, using the polar coordinate version of the color space, rotate the hue around from the initial color in increments. The number of increments is determined by the desired size of the color palette. Then, for each hue value, move the L* up and down the range to find the value that maximizes the distance with all other colors already in the palette.
