These are the largest [big boy purchases](big-boy-purchases.md) I've been thinking about making for a long time. 

There's not a ton of stuff out there I'd like to have. But there are a set of a few items that I know I will eventually buy, it's just about getting to the point where I can and it feels right.

They fit into two categories: cars and cameras.  

### A truck

Why a truck? There's been plenty of instances I've had where a truck would have been a much better option than a car. You can't carry any lumber, for example. Or boxes. Anything long, really. 

Since we've moved out west I've driven our {car} off-road way more than I probably should of. There have been quite a few sketchy moments. Lots of scrapes. 

Point is, I think it's time for a truck. 

### Pentax 6x7

I think this will be the first medium format camera I buy. I've  wanted to get one since photography class in high school. It's definitely at the price point where I could throw the money away and be fine with it, so I think it's about time. 

### Mamiya 7 

This is going to be the first really nice camera I buy, I think. I've told myself I'll only do it once it feels right, and I've shot enough film to know it's right. That time is probably a few years out. 

### Hasselblad X-Pan

When is it going to be time to acquire this machine? 

I absolutely cannot justify spending $5k on a camera. Especially an old electronic analog one that likely couldn't be fixed were it to break. 

But one day I will be able to, at which point I'll snag it. It's something I've wanted since 2017 or so. I will get one one day. 

### A Subaru BRZ 

This is completely unnecessary. I've just wanted one since I was in high school, maybe 2015 or so. And I'm going to buy one when it gets to the point where I could set that money on fire and nothing would change.
