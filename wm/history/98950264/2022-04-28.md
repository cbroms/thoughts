It's funny how after about 20 years or so, the style of that time period becomes particularly apparent and starts to become a bit weird ("We thought that was cool? Ewww.") But when you're living in it, the style just seems normal. 

This [collection of interior design](http://lileks.com/institute/interiors/) from the 70's is a great example. I'm sure at the time this stuff was really cool, but now we look at it and laugh. But surely if that stuff was cool, and now it's not, the same is true of our current style? Today's interior design might be perfectly summed up by [this recent Toro y Moi video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2rc3PuE9Dw): colored lights, houseplants, colored plastic, lots of soft surfaces, painted exposed brick and wood... It's pretty recognizable. 

Will this seem outdated one day? 

What other things we just take to be normal are really an artifact of a transient style? What is timeless? Is anything timeless, really?
