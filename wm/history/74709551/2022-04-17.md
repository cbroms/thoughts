I'm writing this page digitally tonight since Sydney's typing away on the typewriter. I think she's writing a song. So this'll be the first page that I write digitally since I got my typewriter. 

Nice day today, went over for Easter lunch at the parent's house. Spring is feeling very springy what with the cooler weather and rain recently. Now it's sunny and feels very appropriate.  

I started running again this morning; I'm going to try and keep it up. It felt incredible when I got back this morning. I forget how nice it is. 

Going to try and keep up the momentum this week. I got into my work on the first 1D experiment and finally broke through the little puzzles that have been blocking me from continuing. It turned out that all that needed to happen was to switch from designing it with code to designing it in Figma. Evidently that's just how I think more clearly now, who knew. 

So this week I'll finish laying it out completely then jump into implementing it. I'd like to set the goal of finishing the frontend implementation completely by the end of the week. I think I can make it happen. Well, more like I need to make it happen, since this project feels like it's really stalled. So it's *going* to happen.
