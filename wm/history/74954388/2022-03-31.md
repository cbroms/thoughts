![I sometimes get this very weird uncanny feeling when I see food in photographs. There's just something about it that feels wrong in some way. Food is not supposed to exist outside of time. It exists in the present. And then it's eaten and gone. But when you see food preserved in photographic form it manages to transcend time. I stumbled across the documentary Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe from the 70’s by Les Blank. There's a scene where he goes to Chez Panisse and prepares a stew containing his shoe. You see him peel some onions and garlic, tomatoes, there's some hot sauce too. All of the ingredients just look perfect, and yet you recognize that they're all gone, very long ago. The people in the film are still around, as are the places and perhaps some of the objects, but the food most definitely is not. I find myself noticing this with magazines too, and in other movies and T.V. shows. I always wonder what happens to the food--who eats it? Did it get thrown away? Maybe there's something about the fact that we interact with food everyday. Everyday I grab or cook food, and see it disappear. Even if it's not eaten, you can watch it start to decompose after a while; it's a class of things that have a very noticeable lifetime in a way that most other things in the world do not. The timescale on which people or trees age is so much longer to the point that it's harder to be consciously aware of it all the time. Not so with food. I guess this is just another one of those weird things about the brain. Maybe this thought is worth expanding: “Strange sensations.” Although it really needs a better name than that, something a little less easily misinterpretable. 7:45PM / 57F / High of 66F / Foggy, clearing](images/74954388/HescQhIYdP-daily.webp "")
