Someone ([Socrates, maybe](philosophy.md)) said [writing](writing.md) is dead.

Once [something gets written down](the-authority-of-writing.md), it dies. You can no longer interact with the idea as you might in a conversation. It's static, chiseled in a kind of invisible stone.

When ideas are emitted during a discussion, they're alive. You can play with them, push them around and shift them. They're light and plastic. Written down, they're made heavy and frozen.
