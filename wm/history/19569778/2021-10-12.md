There are certain moments where experience snags. You might say it's your brain not quite keeping up, trying to fill in experience in an incomplete and approximate way. You see it and think to yourself "that can't be true, can it?" 

Another way to describe it is in moments where you're able to peer beyond the veil of everyday consciousness and see something beyond it, ever so briefly. Something we're ordinarily not meant to see. 

It's nearly impossible to describe the experience, but is something that happens every now and then.
