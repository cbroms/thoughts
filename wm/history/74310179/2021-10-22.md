The goal of this system is to create an economy of support for projects and their creators. 

1. A project can join the network and will as a result receive basic visibility amongst potentially interested parties. 
2. Each project can receive support from others.
3. Each time a project receives support, by law of the system the project must give away a set percentage of the support to other projects in the network. 

The most important point to consider here is what the incentive is for those to invest in projects on the network. Once money makes it into the network, we can keep it moving around, but the main issue is getting it into the network to begin with.
