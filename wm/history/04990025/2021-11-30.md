The shortness of winter days is both beautiful and challenging. It gives the whole season a particular vibe; it *feels* like winter. The low sun, the early sunset. 

But it also forces a different schedule. It feels like the day is constantly way ahead of you. By the time it's 3:30 in the afternoon it feels like it's basically evening. Working or being outdoors is a much different sort of experience than the summer.
