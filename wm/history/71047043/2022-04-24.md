Some logos I like.

## Pepsico

There's something about this that feels so honest for a junk food conglomerate. No pretending to be fun and approachable here, it's corporate, 80's/90's-modern, and severely brutalist. I love it. 

## American Express

Another solid all caps wordmark. The way the C and the A resolve in "American" is really satisfying, and the fact that the middle of the "E" lines up the the top and bottom pushes the eye forward in a way that makes the logo feel fast yet monolithic and solid.
