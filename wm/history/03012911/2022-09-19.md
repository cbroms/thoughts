I want to *see where the money is going*! Why is that not a thing? 

Most budgeting software seems to be organized around a list of your expenses, with pie charts. Lots of pie charts. 

But I want to see the whole thing, the whole flow of income through expenses through to savings destinations, in something like a sankey diagram. It seems like maybe the most intuitive way to interact with something like a budget. Proportional streams to different locations.
