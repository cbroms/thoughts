I tend to think that [our ability to abstract concepts](abstractions-make-us-human.md) from instances of physical things  is what makes us human. 

This is something people think a lot about, it seems. I was recently reading [an article about elephants](do-elephants-have-souls.md), and the author included a passage from a book called *The Explicit Animal*, which lists out all of these supposedly human-specific traits: 

> Man has called himself (among other things): the rational animal; the moral animal; the consciously choosing animal; the deliberately evil animal; the political animal; the toolmaking animal; the historical animal; the commodity-making animal; the economical animal; the foreseeing animal; the promising animal; the death-knowing animal; the art-making or aesthetic animal; the explaining animal; the cause-bearing animal; the classifying animal; the measuring animal; the counting animal; the metaphor-making animal; the talking animal; the laughing animal; the religious animal; the spiritual animal; the metaphysical animal; the wondering animalâ€¦  Man, it seems, is the self-predicating animal.
