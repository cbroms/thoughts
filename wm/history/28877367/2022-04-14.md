People get caught up in tools as a distraction from actually learning and doing. I probably do too, but I also find directing attention to the tools around me that mostly just disappear into the background and are taken for granted is a great way to find the very best exemplars of what tools should be, and helps me be a better [tool-maker](me.md).

Here are some of the more important tools I use day-to-day to [build with](build-it-yourself.md):

### Digital tools

- **Ubuntu**. 
- **Firefox**. To be honest most browsers are all pretty decent, but some are slightly more decent than others. I like Firefox.
- **DuckDuckGo**. I know it’s basically a re-wrapped version of Bing, but I still enjoy the vibe. Search results are generally good enough and I like [their !bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).
- **[Futureland](https://futureland.tv)**. Where my [process](process.md) is recorded and I work through a daily routine.
- **VS Code**. I recently switched over from Sublime Text, and it’s been pretty good so far with a nice ecosystem of plugins. I just wish it wasn’t quite as _heavy_.
- **Figma**. What a fantastic tool. Seems to have just the right combination of functionality and is super performant. 
- **[Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/)**. I hosted my own email for a few years but eventually gave into using a service when the big G decided to send all my mail to spam. Turns out they just blacklist IP ranges for public cloud providers. Fastmail has been a pretty nice alternative.

### Physical electronic tools

- **A computer**. It runs Ubuntu and Windows. It’s got an i7 8086k, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and an RTX 2060 TI. I’ve had a custom built computer like this for quite a while. I tend to re-use the old components when I sell off pieces of it, so it’s a bit of a [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) situation.
- **A laptop**. It’s a MacBook Pro 13” from 2017 with whatever the cheapest specs are. It’s in the process of nearing it’s date of obsolescence; highly unfortunate.
- **Mechanical keyboard**. It's a Pok3r 60% layout with Cherry MX Brown switches. 

### Physical tools 

- **A knife**. It’s a [Kan Knives Santoku](https://kankitchen.com/meet-the-knives/).
- **A pan.** An All Clad D5 Stainless Brushed 12-inch fry pan. Gorgeous tool.
- **A trenching shovel.** An absolutely essential tool for the garden. Second only to the pickaxe, but the trenching shovel is a bit more broad in its uses.
- **A mechanical pencil**. I've had this [Rotring 600](https://www.rotring.com/pens-pencils/pencils/rotring-600-mechanical-pencil-1/SAP_1904443.html) forever, and it still works perfectly. It feels nice and solid in the hand, the best writing utensil I've encountered.
