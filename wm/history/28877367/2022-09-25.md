I love tools. 

It seems very often people get caught up in tools as a distraction from actually learning and doing. I probably do too, but I also find directing attention to the tools around me--particularly the ones that normally just disappear into the background and are taken for granted--is a great way to find the very best exemplars of what tools should be and helps me learn to be a better tool-maker.
