Turning cash into assets, with the expectation that those assets will yield more cash in the future.  

I started in the summer of 2021, after I began my first real job. The experience has been a bit meh; only a couple months there have been positive and mostly I've just been setting money on fire...

...would be one way to look at it. But [the idea](progress-and-the-stock-market.md) is that DCAing in over a long period of time always works. 

So I'll just keep doing it.
