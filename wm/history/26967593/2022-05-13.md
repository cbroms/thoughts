I started the process of growing tomatoes in February. I planted Roma and San Marzano seeds in 4" pots that I'll keep inside for the next month.

I started leaving them outside all the time around the middle of March.

In mid-April, we planted them at the community garden plot.

About a month later, we installed some trellis structures for them to grow up.
