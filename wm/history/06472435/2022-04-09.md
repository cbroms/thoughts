![Today we started planning our trip to Washington. I realized that I really hate spending money on things whose value is somewhat questionable. I pay like $150 for an AirBnB, and consider all the other things I could have done with that money. $150 is a fair amount of money, it'll buy quite a lot. But for a single night at some AirBnBâ€¦ I don't know. But to be fair the same amount of money spent at a hotel also feels a bit wasted. It just seems excessive for a place to stay. I guess I probably do spend a fair amount on this place each day, I just never think about it in terms of the cost per day, but rather the cost per month. So $1,950 / 30days is $65/day. Well half of that technically since it's divided between us. There's something interesting about seeing the cost of a single day. Not sure why. Maybe I should take my monthly expenses and split them out into a daily expense. And do the same with income. Maybe seeing it on a more familiar and workable timescale makes it more understandable in a way. The daily cost of being alive, something like that. And then the money you're making by being alive too. Kinda interesting. Anyway, the point of that was to say that there's something about the $150ish price tag that makes it so annoying to actually commit to renting one of these places for a night. I'm totally fine with spending the $25 or whatever on a campsite, that feels like a fair price for a predictable product. I know I'm going to enjoy it, but the whole AirBnB thing can be a bit hit or miss. I guess that's why people usually do a chain hotel sort of thing, since the experience is much more dependable and predictable. But that's also exactly why it's so boring. Because it's made to be boring. But the nice thing about the campground is that each is different, each is it's own sort of place, while still being predictable in the important ways.You show up, pull in, and set up all the equipment that you are familiar with and comfortable staying in. You get some sort of a bathroom, and a table, and a fire ring, and maybe a source of water. It's unlikely anyone will come up and bother you, and you can enjoy the place. For a bit over twenty bucks you can't go wrong with that experience. So that was the day. Opened up a ton of tabs, figured out a route, figured out some places we wanted to visit and stay, and groaned as I had to sift through all these AirBnBs. Not as good as a campground, but not as had as a hotel. So it is. I'm still pretty damn excited for the trip, it'll be great to get out and return to this fantastic part of the country. 10:10PM / 56F / High of 70F / Clear and sunny](images/06472435/rTMlrCIorG-daily.webp "")
