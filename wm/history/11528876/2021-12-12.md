Take pride in [your craft](the-craft-of-design.md). It's how we progress towards our potential. 

I recently watched a video of some master craftsmen in Japan [build a house from the ground up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HMa5tofqps). It struck me that individual craftsmanship is just one part of it; there's also a larger community of craftsmen that's essential. Not only [the individual](build-it-yourself.md) but also the whole community moves towards this greater potential.
