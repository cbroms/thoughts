![Today was my and Sydney’s anniversary. We've been together for two years now. We went into the city and did some activities to mark it. We went to the Legion of Honor, which I haven't been to for a while, then walked out to the Sutro Baths. As we were sitting there, this incredible thing happened. It was a warm day, maybe 75F or so, and clear. You could see all the way out into the Pacific to the horizon line, and there were all sort of little sailboats out enjoying the day. Looking out, the horizon suddenly disappeared and became hidden by a grey bank of fog. It was way out, and not too high either. It gradually got taller, pushing towards us. Sailboats became enveloped in it as it progressed to shore, creeping in quite quickly. Ab0ut ten minutes since it first appeared, the first tendrils of fog were wrapping around the rocks on the shoreline below. Half a minute later, it blew into the grove of Cypress trees we were sitting under. This cool, moist blast of air was such a distinctive contrast to the warm, dry air from a few minutes before. It occurred to me that I'd never actually seen a fog bank form before. Is this how all the fog I've experienced is created? If a matter of a few minutes? It just goes to show how incredible the natural world can be when you are able to watch it in a human-centric timescale. Usually weather and growth happens over a period of time that's much too long for us to be able to notice a change. I was thinking yesterday how much the trees at home had grown over the eight years or so since we'd been there. (ten years, actually.) What were once these tiny little trees are now huge green puffs, vastly larger than they were just a few years ago. And yet you only recognize that growth when you step back and think about it, reflect on it. Every other time you see the tree, it just looks like the same tree. But the tree is changes year to year, month to month, and even day to day. We're just really bad at noticing it. Or maybe we could notice it if we actually paid attention to the changes specifically. Last night I actually got quite a bit of productive work on Hyperfov in. I wasn't planning on working, but Sydney was on a call with our friends and I didn't really feel like socializing, so I figured I'd do something more productive. I ended up building a CDN for serving the links package on any site. It was pretty satisfying to get working, and I woke up today thinking a lot about Hyperfov and what I wanted to do next. It really just goes to show how important it is to keep up a decent momentum if you want to get stuff done and make the process as enjoyable as possible. 7:40PM / 55F / High of 76F / Partly cloudy](images/28995974/UpphHFGSIb-daily.webp "")
