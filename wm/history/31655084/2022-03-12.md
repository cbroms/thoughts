![For some reason I'm really tired today. Tonight, anyway. Point being this'll be another really short page that pretty much just summarizes the day. So here it is: - Got up, made some sandwiches, - Drove out to Stinson Beach and hiked up the Dipsea trail to Pantoll, then down again to Stinson in a loop (Ben Nevis trail?), - Drove back home, - Did some gardening, planted some strawberries, - Hug out with the game gang, - Mac and cheese with peas and spinach for dinner, more hanging out with the gang. All and all a pretty nice day. I’d never done that part of the Dipsea trail up to the top of Tam like that, it was pretty nice going all he way from sea level on up to Pantoll. There was some sort of a race going on, so there was a pretty much constant stream of runners coming at us. Eventually we got off the Dipsea and onto steep ravine trail, which was much quieter. It was a pretty great trail; lots of redwoods, a running stream, waterfalls, and even a little section of latter to climb up. Nice, classic northern CA redwoods sort of trail. I think that as nice as these sorts of days are, they often result in no thinking getting translated onto paper. Sydney and I talked about so much over the course of the hike that I couldn’t possibly remember it all, and by the time we got back I was pretty tired and we went right into socializing. Of course now I can't really recall ail of the little mental bookmarks I set for myself, as tends to reliably happen when using mental bookmarks. Maybe I should bring my little writing inbox notebook with me when hiking or even when walking during the week. I should have some time to myself tomorrow, going to try and get started on this whole essay thing I've been writing about for the last week or so pretty much non stop. It's time to make it happen. Look at that, I pretty much filled this page anyways. So it is when ideas start coming, the reflection starts flowing. 9:20PM / 51F / High of 58F / Partly cloudy, cumulus clouds through the afternoon.](images/31655084/RvYbJVtKMu-daily.webp "")
