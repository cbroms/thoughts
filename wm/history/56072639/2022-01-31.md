![An extremely full day today. This morning we decided to rearrange the furniture to a new layout where the bed getsÂ± its own little partition, hopefully resulting in a cozier vibe. That took primarily the entire morning and was mainly composed of moving things around, deciding it wasn't quite right, and moving things around again. Eventually we decided that my desk should face the west side windows, the couch should be where my desk used to be, and the chair should be where the bookshelf used to be, the bookshelf now being next to the couch. I am initially to totally thrilled by this arrangement, but time will tell if I end up liking it. I will say that having my desk by the window is nice as it means I can more easily gaze out at the trees and sky and daydream, an activity I should always do more of. There's also the nice little added benefit of a cool breeze from the window that's slightly ajar in front of me blowing in over the top of my desk and hands. I'm looking forward to the wind on a summer afternoon blowing in from a fog bank moving in from the bay. Maybe this setup will be nice after all. Anyway, after that whole endeavor, we went and met my parents for lunch at this BBQ place in Richmond. It was out on the far side of the Chevron oil refinery, at this strange and secluded marina. There were a few sailboats and a lot of derelict boats being used as houseboats, and a few houseboats mixed in too. The BBQ place was a hodgepodge of hand painted signs, mismatched tables and chairs, potted plants, and general arty weirdness. It reminded me of the sort of spot you might find out in the Mojave desert. I think there's a destination I've heard of like that out by the Salton sea. After lunch we went to Annie's Annuals and picked up some strawberries, which I'm hoping will do well here. Then we went to the Ashby community garden to inquire about a plot, which they Had and were willing to let us use. I think we're going to take it, so it'll be quite the adventure figuring out out all that this spring. Hopefully more sunny vegetables. The final stop of the day was Costco which I haven't visited in quite a while. After a day of eccentricity, I was struck by just how refreshingly normal everyone there seemed to be, especially  compared to Berkeley Bowl, which is our normal grocery store. I need to get out of Berkeley, hah. 9:50PM / 48F / High of 59F / Partly cloudy](images/56072639/nQwOlItGnP-daily.webp "")
