![I got totally carried away with working on button.land today so this is my sad excuse for a pageâ€¢ I finally got the layout looking good by going into Figma and laying something out in about 30sec. Honestly I should do that more for these sorts of projects, it saves me a lot of trouble messing around with styling that looks nasty. That's it, carried away with flexbox, hah. 10:10PM / 50F / High of 70F / Clear with a few high clouds](images/05428208/TnPTqKauFo-daily.webp "")
