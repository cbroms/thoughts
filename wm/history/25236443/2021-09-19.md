What do I think?

There's a lot of possibilities:  

- I am an evangelist and will find a way to bring you to the side of Truth of The Universe, where I find myself sitting amongst the Enlightened Ones. 
- Here's what I think. 
- I might be wrong, but I feel like...
- I actually disagree...
- Uh, maybe I should soften this a bit.  
- Absolutely no way in hell I'm saying it dude. 
- I don't know, but how about that weather we've been having eh? Crazy stuff. 
- Be as sarcastic and caustic as possible because it's funny. 
- Be post-ironic. I *really* just *don't* care. But I *don't*.   
- I have absolutely no opinion. 
- There's something tangentially related I'd rather talk about. 
- Honestly you could not pay me any amount of money to come up with an opinion. 
- I will pick a completely arbitrary opinion on this topic I've never thought about before and stand behind it, fighting until death until I die and ascend to heaven a martyr. 

In actuality it's mostly just picking the right kind of [filter](filtering-expression.md).
