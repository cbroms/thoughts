- 1 3/4 cups white flour
- 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 8 tbsp unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup buttermilk

Mix the dry ingredients. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter until it's pea-sized. Mix in the buttermilk until it's just incorporated. 

Press into a 1/2" thick sheet, then fold over itself in thirds like a letter to create three layers. Press down again into a 1" thick sheet. Cut into rectangles. Brush the tops with some buttermilk. 

Bake at 450F for 20 mins.
