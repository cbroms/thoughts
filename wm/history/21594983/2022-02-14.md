![More thinking on the house plan last week. We've been moving back and forth between thinking we should wait two or three years after we leave the Bay Area to purchase some land and doing so as soon as possible after leaving. The most recent thinking is that we do it as soon as we can. We’ll see how long it takes to return to the initial idea. In general of course I'd love to do this as soon as possible. But the challenge is the same as I laid out before; there's a real psychological and financial challenge to it. We'll need to both be comfortable committing to this project for a minimum of four or five years, and have the funds available to actually purchase the land and build the house without requiring any sort of financing from a bank. By our estimation that will take at the very least one to two years. During that time we'd be here in California working, and then after a year or so move out and rent around the area we’d like to purchase the land. The reason we're even considering this is because it's technically possible. We just need to figure out if it's the thing we actually want to commit to doing, as it will require a ton of planning and preparation. The other aspect to it is the technical challenge of actually building the house. This I have faith we can figure out. There's of course the *right* way to do it, and then there's the way we'll end up doing it, which is more of an intuitive, experimental way. I think regardless of the outcome of the experiment, we'll eventually want to build a house the correct way. So there shouldn't be a huge amount of pressure to take the additional 60% of effort to make this thing that much larger and more "complete." It will be a comfortable, livable place, just done so in a frugal and minimal way. We won't tailor the house to our lives, we'll tailor our lives to the house. We were talking about why it is that this sort of commitment to a person, place, and life is so uncommon among younger people. My hypothesis is that there is an underlying yearning for a lifestyle that's simpler and allows for more control over the circumstances. We are increasingly living in ways that cede control to external entities, and I think that young people are recognizing this danger and how it goes against their nature. Our nature is to build our own lives, to create a place for ourselves by ourselves. To live harmoniously with the world around us, both natural and human. Starting with a bit of land that's cared for and committed to is a good first step to experiment with. Maybe it's all that's really needed. 7:40PM / 52F / High of 56F / Foggy all day](images/21594983/tseUBAplnR-daily.webp "")
