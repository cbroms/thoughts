I'd say one of the most [positive changes](improvements.md) I've made in the last couple years is developing a daily routine. 

With a daily routine, I don't need to think about what I'm going to do, I just do. I've already done the thinking part, so I can just execute. I trust that I've thought it through, and if I disagree in the moment, I defer [the investment](investment.md) of time I've already made in the routine as evidence that I should push through the one day. Lo and behold, I get it done, and it feels good. 

The daily routine has been primarily driven by my experimentation with {Futureland}. I preset all the things I want to do each day, week, and month, and they appear there for me to check off when they should. 

In general I feel like a relatively disciplined person, but this has really just pushed it up a notch and allowed for me to do more, like [writing everyday](projects-as-an-investment.md), or the [set of projects I'm working on](what-im-working-on-now.md).
