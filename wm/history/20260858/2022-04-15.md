I don't really like [recipes](recipes.md). 

I feel they're often too prescriptive and prevent you from gaining a better understanding of what works well together. It's sort of the same problem [driving directions](why-do-driving-directions-suck.md) seem to have; by following instructions in an area you've never driven, you aren't able to learn from your surroundings. 

Anyway, what if rather than specific recipes, dishes were described in terms of proportions of ingredients and flavor combinations? If I'm making some barbecue sauce, I generally want ketchup and half as much vinegar and sugar. More vinegar to get a different sort of style of sauce, more sugar for another. Or I'm making cookies, and want to make them chewy. What ingredients do I manipulate to make a chewier cookie from a cakey one? 

You could also look up dishes from their ingredients. Say I have cauliflower and green onion, what might I make? 

Seems like a tool worth building.
