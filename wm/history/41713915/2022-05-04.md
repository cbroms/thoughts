I was working this evening on [a little experiment](experiment-feeling-of-interfaces.md) that involves building out an interface. 

In the past, I used to think best through code. I'd sit down and start writing a layout, manipulating the styling and structure until it felt right. Sometimes I'd start with a rough sketch of what it should end up looking like, but often the design took place as I was coding. 

I tried to do that for this project and it just wasn't working. The interface was rough and awkward, I got stuck a few times and couldn't figure out how to solve these little puzzles. Tonight I finally decided I'd lay it out in Figma. And about 20 minutes in, all of a sudden the whole thing came together. It all just kind of *worked*. 

It seems like my medium for thinking about interfaces has changed. Probably because I'm working in Figma every day at work, I'm thinking more naturally through that particular [tool](tools.md). It's incredible how much our tools, like language, shape our thought. Or at least *influence* our thought. 

What other mediums might change the process of thinking?
