![I was thinking today again about the potential for the digital medium. About what the next sort of article would look like, and how it might be structured. I've written before about how there's this great potential to make information much more interactive, where rather than simply reading a person's writing, you'd explore their ideas through a malleable medium alongside them. One other thought I had today is that this doesn't need to be a one-way relationship. The reader could just as well provide input into the point of the argument as well, and shape others' experience of it. This is already happening to some extent on sites like Reddit or Hacker News, where people's work takes on a new sort of form when viewed alongside the comments of strangers. But imagine if it were more than just comments, but instead the idea or set of ideas themselves were shaped in response to people's ideas. It’s no longer just about them author and their thoughts, and then the response of the readers, but rather a kind of conversation between all parties. I think there's a huge amount of unexplored potential here. More random things to note today. One of the things I was thinking about at work today was the idea of thresholding, and how you can remap a particular set of values depending on where the start and end are. A good example of this is in Photoshop, where you can pull in the contrast by setting any pixel values above a certain threshold to 255, say, and below a certain threshold to 0. This limits the color space to the new range, and through that process data is loss in service of the higher contrast or whatever the manipulation of choice is. This idea seems to apply well to the space of concepts too. An ideology, for example, could be thought of as a remapping of the full-color and full-resolution real world to a reduced color and resolution version. Ideology is in a sense blinders, or at thresholding function. Data is left out, and the resulting image looks more contrasty than the real world. An interesting analogy, I think. This evening Sydney and I mostly spent talking. She managed to get me on a roll talking about all sorts of stuff, especially around our interesting relationship with Oil. I've been reading a fair bit about it what with the whole situation with Russia, and the history of it is pretty interesting. In short, it seems like despite the possibility of becoming energy-independent, the U.S. has routinely decided to maintain importing crude oil, while exporting oil extracted domestically elsewhere.This seems to have had the effect of creating a lot of leverage for the government, which is able to use these imports and exports as a negotiating chip. Seems like it's all pretty tactful stuff, for better or worse. 10:00PM / 51F / High of 72F / Sunny and clear](images/57451249/LebjBZemLo-daily.webp "")
