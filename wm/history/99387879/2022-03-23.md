![No time to write tonight; it's pretty late. Tonight Sydney started to teach me how to sing. I've been pretty resistant to singing, but once I started if was actually pretty fun. Might try and make this a thing every few days or so in the evenings, it's a nice activity we can both do and be present. 11:10PM / 51F / High of 64F / Clear and sunny](images/99387879/uOdnWqyJHy-daily.webp "")
