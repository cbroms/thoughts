Maybe the best way to overcome any sort of stasis is to just start. 

Depending on the stasis, maybe that's the hard part. But once started, everything starts going and it becomes easier and easier to return and continue working. 

It's the initial bump, the initial little push to actually begin the first few motions that's key. It's like a ball on top of a hill; start it and it'll roll down on its own.
