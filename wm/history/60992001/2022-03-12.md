My partner and I are [building](build-it-yourself.md) a garden and growing some of our own food. I've gardened before, but it's always a great to get back to it; it feels like a necessary and meaningful endeavor.

We have a tiny amount of yard space at the house we rent in Berkeley, and we're trying to take advantage. I built a [raised planter bed](raised-planter-beds.md) and placed it in the sunniest part of the garden we can use. I also prepared a couple areas of [ground to directly plant](direct-planting-vegetables.md) as well along the side of the house. It's a bit tricky since most of the ground we're working with is sideyard, and therefore shady at least half the day. The benefit is that we can grow lots of plants that wouldn't do so well in full sun, especially greens.

Outside our house, we've planted: 

- [Kale](growing-kale.md)
- Collard Greens
- [Mustard Greens](growing-mustard-greens.md)
- Spinach
- Chard
- [Tatsoi](growing-tatsoi.md)
- [Bok Choi](growing-bok-choi.md)
- Radishes
- Basil
- Cilantro
- Parsley 
- Thyme
- Epazote
- Oregano
- Strawberries

Starting in February 2022, we'll also have a plot in a community garden we can use for growing plants that prefer more sun. I'm hoping that will mean tomatoes, cucumber, eggplant, peppers, and other sorts of exciting things. A bit more exciting than [kale](growing-kale.md), that is. 

I'm starting:

- [Tomatoes](growing-tomatoes.md)
- Napa Cabbage
- Japanese Eggplant
- Bell Peppers
