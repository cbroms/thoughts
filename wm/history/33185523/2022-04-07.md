![Late today as usual. It was a work evening on my 1D interactives project. Today was hot. Extremely hot, even for summer. Except there was no nice marine layer since it's April. I did an escape room for the first time today as an outing at work. This was supposedly the best escape room in San Fransisco, and it was pretty fun. I didn't realize it'd be just so many puzzles in a row, and you're speeding through all of them to get it done. This room clearly involved a number of different sensors embedded in the walls and stuff, seems like it'd be pretty fun to build all those little physical hardware puzzles. 10:10PM / 66F / High of 90F (!!!!!!!) / Sunny with high clouds](images/33185523/WCoVeSeCJx-daily.webp "")
