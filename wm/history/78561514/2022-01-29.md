![Something that's been on my mind for a while now is how Hyperfov should feel. What it is like to use it. This is the most important question of the whole project I think. The fact is, there are a ton of other experiments quite like Hyperfov. This is clearly an area where people have done some thinking before, and forums seem to be filled with ideas for systems similar to what I'm imagining. The reason nothing has really worked yet, it seems, is because of extremely poor user experience. The system that appears to be most like mine requires you to install a python package to use. Nobody is going to do that! Everything's designed for the tinkerer, nothing is designed for the explorer. The person who builds the temples the explorer enters is very different from the explorer themselves. Even I, who would consider myself an explorer, tinkerer, and builder am not going to install some experimental python package and go through the trouble for something who's actual functionality is unclear. That's the other trouble: communication. These projects have either absolutely no documentation, or an enormous wiki you have to sift through. So that is the key them. Build something that people can immediately understand, and build something that can be installed and used with minimal friction. Easier said than done. But for this project in particular, essential. So thinking about how the tool should feel to use is constantly on my mind. Right now my thought is that its vibe is pulled from the very first time the internet and hypertext were being designed and thought about. Some of those first figures in Xanadu, for example. 0r Engelbart's "The Mother of all Demos." Clean forms, extreme simplicity as a necessity. Maybe a monospace typeface. The system should click on in a tactile way, informationâ€¨should be presented in chunks. Given the goal is to present the interface with the internet in a new way, it should feel clean, mathematical, and calculated. The expressiveness should come from the information that inhabits the space, not the system itself. It should not try to be fancy and pretend to be something that it's not. This is a machine, and it should feel like interfacing with a machine of impossible capability. It seems work on FL with slow over the next month, so it's a good opportunity to lay the groundwork for Hyperfov. I'm ready to get into it. 9:00AM / 54F / High of 61F / Partly cloudy](images/78561514/QaZIGhSGdn-daily.webp "")
