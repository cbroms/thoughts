![Excellent progress today. The link previews package is pretty much done, mostly the only thing left to do is publish it. Today I finished figuring out how to deal with providing a template so people don't have to start from scratch whenever they want to use it. I think the system I ended up with will work pretty nicely; I can add more templates as time goes on without needing to change too much. The other thing I worked on today was splitting out and importing/exporting the code, then building out the final file. Unsurprisingly this turned out to take the longest of everything simply because it meant messing around with a bunch of build config files and (re)learning web pack. It always seems to be that these sorts of things are annoying to set up because you only have to set it up once per project; if you had to interact with it every time you wanted to do some development, the tool would be much easier to use. Sometime this week I'll publish the package and convert all my sites to use it. It's a good test of it; if it's simple for me to set up and style across all my sites, then it's ready for use. I think this is called "dogfooding.‚Äù This evening I was watching a series on YouTube about how to build a concrete retaining wall. It was 12 or so parts, each going into depth on excavating, setting the formwork, pouring, and everything that goes into each of the steps. It's certainly quite the process. The amount of collective knowledge that goes into something like pouring concrete is insane. How do 
we know all of this stuff? There's just so many pieces to consider, so many little lessons that must have been learned and passed down to become common knowledge. The fact that something so foundational is so complicated is so impressive; there are so many people involved with ensuring the process is done in a safe and proper manner. There's just so much about the world that we collectively take for granted. Something as pedestrian as a concrete retaining wall is such a complicated thing that unless you're somehow involved with the process, that complication is just unknown and unappreciated. I'm sure there's a ton about the world that I am unaware of the complexity behind, and therefore take for granted. Everything is complex. 10:10PM / 47F / High of 66F / Clear](images/03186581/kuqHAWHtci-daily.webp "")
