## California

### HWY 50 / El Dorado NF

- Silver Creek and the meadow at the intersection of Wright's lake Rd and the road to/from Ice House. 
- Van Vleck trailhead. Looked to be some good spots in the meadow by the bunkhouse. Satellite view shows a meadow maybe 50 yards east of the parking area. 

### CA-88 / El Dorado NF / Humboldt-Toiyabe NF

- The middle section of Blue Lakes Rd. Good meadow spots along the west fork of the Carson River. 
- Could be some nice spots between Silver Lake and Carson Pass, would need to investigate further (Forestdale Rd?).

### CA-108 / Stanislaus NF / Humboldt-Toiyabe NF

- Gianelli trailhead. Up on top of the bluff looking southwest. 
- CA-108 just east of Sonora Pass. Lots of nice spots off the highway around Sardine Creek. 

### Eastern Sierra / Toiyabe NF

-  CA-270 on the way to Bodie. Some trails into the hills right off HWY 395. BLM land.
