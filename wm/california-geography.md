[California](california.md) has perhaps the most varied [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_California), flora, and fauna of any state in the United States, possibly worldwide. 

I love that about it; there's just so much to explore, so many different sorts of places to experience. It makes living here incredibly unique.
