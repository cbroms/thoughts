[California](california.md) has perhaps the most varied [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_California), flora, and fauna of any state in the United States, possibly worldwide. 

I love that about it; there's just so much to explore, so many different sorts of places to experience. It makes living here incredibly unique. 

My partner and I took [a weekend trip to the eastern sierra](trip:-eastern-sierra-2021.md) and I found myself appreciating the uniqueness of the situation--we'd driven from the bay area to the high desert in just a few hours. There's not a lot of places in the country--world even--that you can do that. California's a very special place in that regard.
