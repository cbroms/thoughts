![What systems contribute towards the progress of humanity,? Are there any heuristics we can use to assess the way that a given system may or may not contribute? One that came to mind today was the impact of the system on people's behavior. It's very simple. Once introduced, does this system change how people behave in a way that is generally positive, or negative. I tend to think answering this question isn't that hard. There are plenty of values we hold at a societal level, and we can use those to evaluate the state of society after the system is introduced. Cryptocurrencies, for example, would be a tenuous example of progress under this heuristic. They fail the "do they make people better" question simply by virtue of how they enable even more scamming and fraud than before they were introduced. And there's the fact than none of the fraud that's done is reversible; there aren't mechanismsâ€¨to allows people to recover from being scammed. On this single point alone, you could make an argument that the more nebulous "freedoms" that crypto afford are nullified by these incredible negatives. The system enables negative behavior, and amplifies its affects. Such a system is flawed at the very least, if not detrimental to real progress. It does not make people better, it makes them worse. Worth more thought. Helpful to sort out what "progress" really means. 10:20PM / 60F / High of 80F (!l) / Clear an~ sunny](images/58102327/FyHVqfclfY-daily.webp "")
