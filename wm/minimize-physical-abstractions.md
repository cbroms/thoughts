When possible, try to opt for things that are closer to their original state. For example, wood for heating over propane, local  food over imported, local services over national or international ones. 

This sort of [local-first](local-first.md) frame seems like it might be an important part of [minimizing the effects of climate change](addressing-climate-change.md) in a more holistic, beyond simply focusing on carbon reduction. By removing layers of abstraction, we remove the waste produced at each of these layers.
