There's something unfortunate about writing that comes from turning a *non-physical thought* into a *concrete recorded thought*.

Suddenly, the thought becomes *a thought*, manifested. It's something different that others can interact with. It's no longer just a *notion*, it's a *real thought*. It becomes important to consider the social aspects of the thought, including [keeping in congruence](hypocrisy-and-contradiction.md) with everything that's already been said. 

Simply by writing the thought down, it has a new air of authority--it seems to represent something you believe. I don't think it's possible to write in a truly open way, a way where even you don't view what's written down as something possibly completely meaningless and most certainly incomplete.
