The goal of this project is to develop random visual symbols for each thought on [this site](one-dimension.md).  

These visuals should have some kind of innate hierarchy. Because  [thoughts link to each other](one-dimension-network.md), we can start to develop a kind of genetic simulation, where the *genes* of each thought are inherited and produce new *expression*. 

I've begun to work on this by exploring how [genes might be inherited](gene-inheritance.md) and am now beginning to consider how to create patterns for these symbols. 

I'm particularly inspired by [Japanese *Mon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_(emblem)):

I'm not expecting to get something nearly as beautiful, and the goal isn't to have such intricate detail. The first goal is to just figure out how to generate some sort of symbol that uses some notion of inheritance that's recognizable.  

Progress can be found on the [One Dimension Futureland journal](https://futureland.tv/christian/entry/118937).
