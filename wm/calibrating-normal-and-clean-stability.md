![The bread worked today. It's always a good day when the bread end up working. I feel like I write a lot about the breadmaking process, about how I tweak this or that and "it solves everything that's been going wrong" or something like that. But to be honest I keep managing to mess it up, then go back to doing it well, then back to sucking. At risk of doing the exact thing I just turned into a meme, I think the key is to really let it get nice and puffy. But this is one of those things that I seem to always think I get right; there's never really been a time that I thought the dough clearly wasn't right, but rather 'just kind of normal. I guess I really need to reassess what normal is, as it's always when the dough feels extraordinary in some way that it really works. What else to note? I donI t know, life just sort of keeps chugging on. Not in a baa way, nothing to complain about. In fact things just feel pretty damn nice right now. Not that some of the plans we have for the future anent there, or a priority, but I'm not going to let them distract from what is an otherwise pretty damn great existence. Been trying to spend a lot more time outside lately, I think that's definitely contributing. I feel like I hear a lot of talk about people my age or a bit older than my age just kinda being miserable. People being in a kind of perennial "rough place." I am unsure exactly how much control I have over the fact that I don't feel like this, haven't ever really felt like this. Even when I was in Omaha, I think that experience wasn't that bad, bad in the sense that I didn't learn from it or grow in some way. But as I say, I'm unsure how much of that is on my own sort of approach to things versus just chance or circumstance or whatever. Maybe this is something I•11 figure out one day, looking back on now as some sort of lucky moment. I certainly hope that's not the case, that even if things get a bit less obviously nice I'll still learn from that and find some way to grow. If things aren't going so well, at least afford yourself that man. 10:00PM / 51F / High of 61F / Clear and sunny](images/78353603/PrsarVkabM-daily.webp "")
