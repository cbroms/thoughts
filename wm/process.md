As far as I can tell, the most important part of any creative endeavor is the process. 

It's where you and the artifacts you're working on [develop](growth.md). The [future state](design.md) you envision is most interesting in its manifestation though the many incremental steps between here and there. 

I log much of my process on [my projects](what-im-working-on-now.md) on [Futureland](https://futureland.tv/christian).
