Hyperfov is an ongoing endeavor to make the experience of the [web](the-internet.md) *beyond-informational*. 

How might we introduce a [non-human element](who-are-we.md) to the internet? Where do unexpected connections arise? How do we give form to the underlying structure of the internet? 

So far, I've begun two explorations within the Hyperfov realm: 

- [Proto-hyperfov](https://futureland.tv/christian/entry/68730), a way of browsing the internet though links between websites. 
- [Page previews](page-previews.md), which provide contextual information about a link on hover.
