What are the tools needed by today's [internet](the-internet.md) frontiersman? 

The goal of Hyperfov is to provide those tools, whatever they may be. 

At the moment, Hyperfov isn't much; just a couple of exploratory projects here and there. But I envision a toolset that's designed to fit harmoniously together in order to support the exploration of the web at an entirely new resolution. Not just thinking about about webpages and the information within, but the connections between pages and the information that emerges from those links. 

So far, I've begun two explorations within the Hyperfov realm: 

- [Proto-hyperfov](https://futureland.tv/christian/entry/68730), a way of browsing the internet though links between websites. 
- [Page previews](page-previews.md), which provide contextual information about a link on hover.
