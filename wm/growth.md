You only recognize growth when you step away for a while.

I’m sure this is obvious to parents–the ever-present “you’re growing up so fast” is evidence enough–but it becomes easy to overlook. I recently came back to [my garden](garden.md) after a weekend away and found everything grew more in those three days I was away than in the past three weeks prior. Of course the plants hadn’t _actually_ grown any more than they usually had, I just stopped observing them on a daily basis and could therefore better recognize the growth.

An obvious [truism](truisms.md), but worth remembering nonetheless.
