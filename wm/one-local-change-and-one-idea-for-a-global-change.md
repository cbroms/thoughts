![At long last it is raining again. Not just a couple of minutes of drizzle but real rain. By the end of the storm it should have rained a bit under an inch, maybe 0.5-0.75” total. That's real enough for me. I'm done with this months of no rain at all. Each night I've sat here and typed "clear and sunny" at the end of each one of these page, and it's getting pretty boring. Yes, sun and blue skies are nice but not when there's nothing else at all to give a little flavor. But that just seems to be how the weather here is; I'm sure that in a month or so everyday I'll be writing "foggy, clearing" for quite a while. Then it’ll be August and I’ll be back to writing "clear and sunny" over and over again. So it is. I stumbled across this article this evening about the cost of lumber, and there were some references to lumber futures. It seemed to stimulate an idea for me, something about the interconnectedness of the world. Whenever something like the price of lumber changes, people begin arguing over the cause. It's often not immediately clear what *caused* the change, but of course everyone has their ideas. But it seemed to me that some of these sorts of discussions are really important. We need to understand the complex chains of dependencies that the modern world is built on, we need to have a better sense of what levers exist to be pulled. We're all at the mercy of seemingly unrelated events on the other side of the world, despite the fact that wars or politics in other countries don't have anything to do with us, they do have an affect on us. Because it seems globalization was the answer for how the future world will function, it's imperative that we, as a society, develop a real understanding for the moving parts. This should not be one of those things that we just cede to those with more power, this is the sort of thing that the everyman needs to know. Because once things become opaque, anything could happen. The other part of this is that these long dependency chains are incredibly complicated, and untangling them is nearly impossible for an individual. As a result, it seems like this sort of endeavor is well suited for the crowd, as it were, for the internet. Collectively, there's a great deal of understanding to be put together. Or rather, understanding to arise when the pieces are brought together. Each1 individual’s experience can be fit together to form a better understanding of the whole than any one 'expert' could. This seems like a project worth pursing, now, especially. I'll keep ruminating on it. 8:15PM / 56F / High of 64F / Cloudy all day, rain now](images/51984494/FeumKxToyq-daily.webp "")
