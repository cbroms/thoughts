I woke up today thinking about a tool I own called a trenching shovel. Not sure why, but probably because I've been planning what to add to [the garden](garden.md) this year as spring approaches. Anyways, I thought about this shovel. 

The thing with a trenching shovel is that it is perfectly suited for [California](california.md) soil. There is perhaps no better implement for picking away at the rock-hard clay in the summer, or heavy wet clay in the winter. Every other shovel type is inadequate in some way; this one is *perfect*.  

The trenching shovel is not all great though. There are instances of the shovel that you can find at Home Depot, for example, that are clearly low-quality. I once went to pick one up and the only options they had were trenching shovels with plastic handles. Clearly, this was going to be a problem. Sure enough, after hitting the first of what was sure to be many rocks of its life, this trenching shovel's handle snapped. It turned out it would only hit a single rock in its life. 

You really want a wooden handle on these; anything else isn't really a trenching shovel. 

I think as a [tool-maker](tools.md), I should strive to create the equivalent of the trenching shovel. The tool that is just-so. Just-so in it's design (small shovel head, pointed, light) and just-so in it's implementation (high-quality steel head made in Mexico, real wood handle.) The two come together to make a tool that fits just perfectly into its context. 

Of course the only way to really know if a tool is at trenching-shovel levels of perfection is to try a lot of tools, most of which will not be right. Maybe you discover that the particular combination of traits is perfect for the context. 

But maybe there's another way too--to look at the environment around and distill down the qualities that will be most relevant to creating a tool to interact with it. This is *hard*, and requires knowing which qualities to look for, as well as the way the interaction will work. This, I suppose, is what they call "intuition." 

The first approach is what I mainly do now. I'm a novice, learning a lot. The second approach is what I strive more towards over time; developing the intuition of a [true craftsman](the-craft-of-design.md).
