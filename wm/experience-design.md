Really all [design](design.md) should be concerned with experience. 

When experience isn't considered too deeply: 

- [Why do driving directions suck?](why-do-driving-directions-suck.md)
- [Missing the "easy" way](missing-the-easy-way.md)
- [Common errors](common-errors.md)
- [Putting up with small annoyances](putting-up-with-small-annoyances.md)

When experience is excellent: 

- [Spreadsheets](spreadsheets.md)
