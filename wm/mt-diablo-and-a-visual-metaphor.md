![Just returned from a walk on Mt. Diablo this afternoon. I've never been up there before, so it was quite cool to see this place that I've recognized from afar but never really seen up close. It's much like Mt. Tam in that it's a state park, has a road all the way to the top, and has some sort of a historic fire lookout sort of thing at the top. It's also covered in fire roads and little trails that snake back and forth up and down the mountain. But what seems to set Diablo apart, so far as I can tell, is that it's pretty high, and set inland a bit. This combination means that as you go up in elevation, the botanic diversity is quite noticeable. The lowest part of the mountain is the familiar sort of oak woodland you get out elsewhere around the bay; open meadows and lots of large old valley oaks. No live oaks though, I guess that's a bit more of a coastal thing. Getting up a bit higher, you begin to see more buckeyes and it gets a bit more lush with ferns and moss and whatnot. After that there's a pretty noticeable change to a drier sort of climate and start seeing more pines, the same sort you get in the Sierra foothills. In fact the whole thing reminded me a lot of the foothills, as there were also some of those blue oaks mixed in, along with lots of manzanita. I found the geology quite curious too; there seemed to be a ton of variation depending on which elevation and side of the mountain you were on. Towards the middle, for example, there were all these interesting (sandstone?) formations, and then more towards the top there seemed to be a mot of serpentine. All in all, quite a diverse and varied place to explore. I imagine I'll definitely be back, although the summer would surely be roasting out there. Anyways, Sydney and I did a little loop around the mountain, about 6 or so miles all a round. We talked about this and that, but I think the highlight was a conversation we had about people's interaction with life. It centered around a visual metaphor that I think I'll write a note about later, but the point is, was a really compelling metaphor. The idea was essentially that people are like these little blobs launched out into a space that they cannot see. They have a certain trajectory set for them at first, but over time they find that they have some power to change it a bit. The crucial point is this: as they're flying through this space, there's these invisible objects that float around, and some of these people-blobs inevitably hit these objects. These objects leave an imprint in the people- blobs, who soak op the impact and either change course or continue along. But the hit always sticks with them. People are determined by the objects they hit, and the way those hits do and do not define them. I'll try and write up the idea a bit more eloquently now. 5:20PM / 56F / High of 60F / Cloudy and cool](images/73518724/qjCnbjGPuC-daily.webp "")
