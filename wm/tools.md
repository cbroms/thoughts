<p>People get caught up in tools as a distraction from actually learning and doing. I probably do too, but I see myself as <a href="me.md">a tool maker</a> and so often assessing and adjusting the tools I use is a good learning exercise. I also find directing attention to the tools around me that mostly just disappear into the background and are taken for granted is a great way to find the very best exemplars of what tools should be.   </p>
<p>Here are some of the more important tools I use day-to-day to build with:</p>
<h3 id="digital-tools">Digital Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firefox</strong>. To be honest most browsers are all pretty decent, but some are slightly more decent than others. I like Firefox. </li>
<li><strong>DuckDuckGo</strong>. I know it’s basically a re-wrapped version of Bing, but I still enjoy the vibe. Search results are generally good enough and I like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">their !bangs</a>. </li>
<li><strong><a href="https://futureland.tv">Futureland</a></strong>. Where my process is recorded and I work through a daily routine. </li>
<li><strong>VS Code</strong>. I recently switched over from Sublime Text, and it’s been pretty good so far with a nice ecosystem of plugins. I just wish it wasn’t quite as <em>heavy</em>. </li>
<li><strong>Figma</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>iTerm</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a></strong>. Hosted my own email for a few years but eventually gave into using a service when the big G decided to send all my mail to spam. Turns out they just blacklist IP ranges for public cloud providers. Fastmail has been a pretty nice alternative.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="physical-tools">Physical Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A computer</strong>. It runs Ubuntu and Windows. It’s got an i7 8086k, 16GB DDR4 RAM, and an RTX 2060 TI. I’ve had a custom built computer like this for quite a while. I tend to re-use the old components when I sell off pieces of it, so it’s a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a> situation. </li>
<li><strong>A laptop</strong>. It’s a MacBook Pro 13” from 2017 with whatever the cheapest specs are. It’s in the process of nearing it’s date of obsolescence; highly unfortunate.  </li>
<li><strong>A knife</strong>. It’s a <a href="https://kankitchen.com/meet-the-knives/">Kan Knives Santoku</a>. </li>
<li><strong>A pan.</strong> An All Clad D5 Stainless Brushed 12-inch fry pan. Gorgeous tool. </li>
<li><strong>A trenching shovel.</strong> An absolutely essential tool for the garden. Second only to the pickaxe, but the trenching shovel is a bit more broad in its uses.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was going to add this to the list, but I realized I really don’t use it much and definitely don’t use it to create anything. It’s still on here because I like ranting: </p>
<ul>
<li><del><strong>A phone</strong></del>. It’s an iPhone XR that I got when my old iPhone 6s died. I was in <a href="omaha-nebraska.md">Omaha</a> without a car at the time and walked to the only Verizon store in the city only to find that the least-fancy phone I could get was an iPhone XR. It seems inferior to my old phone in pretty much all of the meaningful ways I can think of.</li>
</ul>
