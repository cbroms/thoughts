![Packed day. We started by talking for way too long (till almost 11AM) and then made some sandwiches for lunch. We drove out to Briones regional park and went on a loop walk, which we didnâ€™t get long into before we had to take a shortcut back because Sydney was having some really bad allergies and was blowing snot everywhere. But we did sit for a bit and eat our lunch. I thought it was really nice out there, the last little bit of green grass before summer. Then we came back and talked for a bit more, before leaving around 4:30 for the city. We took the bart over, then want to a place Sydney thought was going to be a mall, but was really just a food court. So we left and got some dinner at a Japanese place (ramen) and then went back to the fake mall to see a movie. We watched The Northman, which I really enjoyed. It was by the guy who did The Lighthouse, and definitely had a similar sort of feel. After that we took the bart back home, and how we're here. 11:58PM / 52F / High of 70F / Clear and sunny](images/12445014/VHYcHtOREG-daily.webp)
