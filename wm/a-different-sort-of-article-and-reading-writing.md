![I'm thinking of starting a blog. Yes, yes, I have a lot of blogs already. But I mean a real blog. One of the sorts of things that has an RSS feed, can you imagine. The reason I've been avoiding this is that I don't feel that I have anything that I should say to an 'audience.' I mean, what do I know about anything? I'm 23. But I think I do have some underlying desire to write something that's read by others. Dumb. Whatever. It's worth trying. But the trick is that I really don't have anything to say. Or rather, anything that I'd feel comfortable speaking about in a way others would read. I’ve written a bit before about the strange authority things have once they're written down; people treat written ideas as much more immovable things than spoken ideas. And so I'd need to make sure I'm not accidentally falling into the trap that most internet writers seem to fall into: becoming too self-absorbed. I know that anyone with an ounce of self-awareness should be able to avoid this, but I fear that the reason that so many don't and get trapped is that they're writing, and their writing is read my others. That alone seems like it'd be enough for someone to start thinking that what they're writing is worth reading, at a minimum. Or worse yet, that what they're writing is *true.* No. This cannot be. An alternative that I’ve thus far been comfortable with is treating what's written as a snapshot in time, a single point along a line that's constantly being defined. So if someone reads something, they're getting a little snippet of something larger, not the real, true, correct, immovable IDEA. Another thought I had today was to treat the article as a little piece of learning. Not starting it with a thesis that you defend, but rather asking a question and exploring it over the course of the piece. Ideally, this would not even end in a conclusion that's presented to the reader; they'd draw their own conclusion. There are some really nice examples of this made by some dude I came across once about various topics in physics. In these articles, the author presents the ideas through a series of interactive interfaces, allowing you to learn what he's describing in a way that feels like is your own. The real work he's done is made these really nice interactive examples and come up with a nice outline, everything else is left to the reader. Maybe something worth exploring. 7:40PM / 53F / High of 58F / Cloudy, a little bit of drizzle today! Evaporated as soon as it hit the ground…](images/86302990/SpUZjXzddL-daily.webp "")
