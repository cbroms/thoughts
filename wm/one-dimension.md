One dimension is an experimental [writing](writing.md) system that links thoughts together through bi-directional links.  

The goal of this system is to explore the creation of a recorded and constantly evolving body of reflection and synthesis. I don't know if this will be the *best* medium for it, but it seems like a decent first step.

I've elected to make One Dimension publicly-viewable. There's something important about putting these thoughts into a form that's readable, even if it's never actually read. A symbolic gesture for myself. That said, the quality is likely to be variable. I'll probably write a lot of [contradicting](hypocrisy-and-contradiction.md) things here. Things I eventually disagree with, changes in thinking. It's my hope that [growth](growth.md) can be better recorded through a system like this. 

I built One Dimension as part of a larger yearlong endeavor to [create a series of small websites](twelve-websites.md).
