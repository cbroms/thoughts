One dimension is an experimental [writing](writing.md) system that links thoughts together through bi-directional links.

The goal of this system is to explore the creation of a recorded and constantly evolving body of reflection and synthesis. I don’t know if this will be the _best_ medium for it, but it seems like a decent first step.

I’ve elected to make One Dimension [publicly viewable](working-in-public.md). There’s something important about putting these thoughts into a form that’s readable, even if it’s never actually read. A symbolic gesture for myself. That said, the quality is likely to be variable. I’ll probably write a lot of [contradicting](hypocrisy-and-contradiction.md) things here. Things I eventually disagree with, changes in thinking. It’s my hope that [growth](growth.md) can be better recorded through a system like this.

I built One Dimension as part of a larger yearlong endeavor to [create a series of small websites](twelve-websites.md). This project is a bit of a mash up of different systems I find inspiring, primarily [Xanadu](xanadu.md), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) and [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net).

### How it’s built

One Dimension is a folder of markdown files on my desktop. I built a series of tools to interact with those files and save and edit them from my browser. The online version of the site is generated as a bunch of static files and served from AWS S3 object storage behind Cloudflare’s CDN. The source code for all of these tools can be found in the [project’s repository](https://github.com/cbroms/thoughts).
