We finally picked up some whetstones to do some real sharpening of our kitchen knife.

The process of running the knife up and down the stone is really peaceful, you just sort of keep a nice rhythm and switch from side to side. Then you move over to the strop and give it a bit more back and forth. 

Sharpening my pocketknife was the best: it was far more sharp and much more beautiful after sharpening than it'd ever been. I had this realization as I held it that I'd just made a weapon with my  own hands. Very [strange sensation](strange-mental-phenomena.md).
