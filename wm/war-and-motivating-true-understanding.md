![This evening I gave in and watched some of the coverage of the war in Ukraine. I've been reading some updates, which has given me some serious flashbacks to when I used to read the news more often. But today I caved and actually watched some videos. It was predicable. The narrative was immediate and seemingly impossible to miss. The attack on the people of Ukraine was brutal, unjustified, and immoral. The images were designed to appeal to the heart; a man holding his hand to the glass of a train as it departed, his son's hand pressed to the other side. Mothers desperately trying to get their children out of the country, shoved in crowds and sheltering in subways. Appeals from citizens to the west for assistance, appeals to Putin to stop. Who, you wonder, could support such a thing? Therein lies the trouble. I agree with the images, with the brutality and needlessness of it. Such a thing should not happen. And yet, watching the news, the narrative is too clear. Good and evil are too simply drawn. Even in Russia, correspondents focus their lenses on those that protest. The government is portrayed as tyrannical, silencing opposition and forcing confrontation, the leaders bloodthirsty. Such portrayals are cartoonish. Pure evil does not exist. No, these individuals are acting for a reason, there are motivations driving this war. Putin is not a sociopath, he is just another man. Why does this make sense to him? And, perhaps more interestingly, why do so many support this leader? What is it about Putin the man that speaks to so many in Russia? What is their perspective of the world? I sense it would not be so foreign to us if truly explored. Instead, we get this emotional pornography. The good guys and bad guys are colored in for us. Does anyone with someplace to say something actually say something I haven't heard before; say something that helps us to learn something new? Rather we have everyone saying the same thing, appealing to our humanity and wishing us to feel bad and do something about it. Yes! I feel bad, it is a great tragedy. But I don't need to be told it is like some sort of retarded child who can't see it. These institutions seem to value above all else showing people something they can relate to. I want to see something I don't understand, to explore something that is beyond me. The emotional aspect is important surely--people must see the real impact of a war--but equally so an exploration into the motivations of all involved, not just Putin. True understanding, in a real human way, the goal. I wonder how I can contribute to such a goal. 9:30PM / 53F / High of 71F / Mostly clear](images/80185549/mwDcNHYYML-daily.webp "")
