[Tatsoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsoi) has proven to be quite an easy green to grow. We planted it from seeds we started during the summer and transplanted a few weeks later. It was actually a bit of an accident we ended up with tatsoi--the seeds were advertised as bok choi but turned out to be something different. It's proven to be a nice little surprise.

I planted them in a raised bed that gets afternoon sun and water about once a week.

The plants have grown to 8" rosettes. I harvest the outer leaves once they reach the soil. I've been harvesting since late August, and it's now almost November and the plants still look great. They haven't gone to seed at all, unlike the spinach that I planted which bolted immediately.
