[Tatsoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsoi) has proven to be quite an easy green to grow. We planted it from seeds we started during the summer and transplanted a few weeks later. It was actually a bit of an accident we ended up with tatsoi--the seeds were advertised as bok choi but turned out to be something different. It's proven to be a nice little surprise.

I planted them in a raised bed that gets afternoon sun and water about once a week.

The plants have grown to 8" rosettes. I harvest the outer leaves once they reach the soil. I've been harvesting since late August, and it's now almost November and the plants still look great.
