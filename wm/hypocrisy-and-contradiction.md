It seems that there’s a fundamental sort of distaste we have for people that are hypocrites. A base instinctual mistrust, a dis-ease. It’s a "get him outta here" kind of thing. "Can’t trust that guy." There’s something evolutionary there I think.

Am I a hypocrite? Yes. Do I find myself hating hypocrites? Yes.

It’s so easy to hate hypocrites. They make it easy simply by the nature of their hypocrisy. I certainly won’t pretend be above that sort of thing.

And yet, who can deny not being a hypocrite at some point? We all are, espousing some gibberish about how people, ourselves included, "should act." Do we _always_ act in accordance to those standards? No.

The _should_ part seems to be key. We imagine some way of being, some future, better state. If we believe in it, that's its something we want, we use that _should_ word. People _should_ act this way. We _should_ all do this. You _should_ try this. Then it turns out that we _don't_.

I think this says less about the person doing the _should-ing_ and more about the goal; the original design for the future state that brought about the will-to-should. If you can’t act in accordance to whatever the principles of that future state are, then perhaps [the future state](design.md) was not as fleshed out as it _should_ have been, not presented in as nuanced a light as it _should_ have been. Or maybe it was wrong altogether.
