<p>It seems that there’s a fundamental sort of distaste we have for people that are hypocrites. A base instinctual mistrust, a dis-ease. It’s a “get him outta here” kind of thing. “Can’t trust that guy.” There’s something evolutionary there I think. </p>
<p>Am I a hypocrite? Yes. Do I find myself hating hypocrites? Yes. </p>
<p>It’s so easy to hate hypocrites. They make it easy simply by the nature of their hypocrisy. I certainly won’t pretend be above that sort of thing. </p>
<p>And yet, who can deny not being a hypocrite at some point? We all are, espousing some gibberish about how people, ourselves included, “should act.” Do we <em>always</em> act in accordance to those standards? No. </p>
<p>The <em>should</em> part seems to be key. We imagine some way of being, some future, better state. If we believe in it, that’s its something we want, we use that <em>should</em> word. People <em>should</em> act this way. We <em>should</em> all do this. You <em>should</em> try this. Then it turns out that we <em>don’t</em>. </p>
<p>I think this says less about the person doing the <em>should-ing</em> and more about the goal; the original design for the future state that brought about the will-to-should. If you can’t act in accordance to whatever the principles of that future state are, then perhaps <a href="design.md">the future state</a> was not as fleshed out as it <em>should</em> have been, not presented in as nuanced a light as it <em>should</em> have been. Or maybe it was wrong altogether. </p>
