Am I a hypocrite? Yes. Do I find myself hating hypocrites? Yes. 

It seems that there's a fundamental sort of distaste we have for people that are hypocrites. A base instinctual mistrust, a dis-ease. It's a "get him outta here" kind of thing. "Can't trust that guy." There's something evolutionary there I think. 

It's so easy to hate hypocrites. They make it easy simply by the nature of their hypocrisy. I certainly won't pretend be above that sort of thing. 

And yet, who can deny not being a hypocrite at some point? We all are, espousing some gibberish about how people, ourselves included, "should act." Do we *always* act in accordance to those standards? No. 

The *should* part seems to be key. We imagine some way of being, some future, better state. If we believe in it, that's its something we want, we use that *should* word. People *should* act this way. We *should* all do this. You *should* try this. Then it turns out that we *don't*. 

I think this says less about the person doing the *should-ing* and more about the goal; the original design for the future state that brought about the will-to-should. If you can't act in accordance to whatever the principles of that future state are, then perhaps [the future state](design.md) was not as fleshed out as it *should* have been, not presented in as nuanced a light as it *should* have been. Or maybe it was wrong altogether.
