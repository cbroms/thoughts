I really like paper maps, they are incredible [tools](tools.md). 

Digital maps can of course hold a lot more information and provide details at a variety of resolutions. They have their place, certainly. 

But there's something special about spending an hour pouring over  a physical map, wandering around trails and mountains, rivers and lakes. The limit of a single scale means you can't get impatient and zoom out, you actually have to explore and take it all in. They're also usually quite large, so you have to unfold them and lay them out. Something about this physicality is important.
