![Pretty damn exceptional day today. We ended up pretty much just sitting outside on the deck for the entire day. The temperature was just so, a nice sixty five or so, gentle breeze, lots of sun. And all we did was sit. There were other plans we had for the day, but it turned out they weren't needed. I love these sorts of days. This was a pretty unusual one in that we did nothing *the entire day* but any day that includes an hour or more of sitting in the sun quietly or having a good discussion is perfect. Perhaps this is what I should be optimizing for; time to do nothing at all. This evening I did get a couple of hours to work on my 1Dexp. Made some great progress. I've come up with the main interaction, a slider that allows you to control the amount of lag in the interface. You'll be able to adjust the amount of lag and try out different amounts on the controls, and then set a threshold at which the interface *feels* laggy. By doing so you vote, and you'll be able to see the average vote of everyone else laid out on the slider. I think it'll be pretty sweet; the interaction is already feeling really clean, simple, and kind of fun. And it's just using the default input component, there was not any reason to build a custom input slider. I'm starting to imagine a whole bunch of these little interactives. Interactives is a pretty good name for them. Better than 1Dexp. Maybe that'll be my "internal" name for them, lol. Thatâ€™s it for today. 8:30PM / 54F / High of 67F / Clear, mostly sunny with the occasional cloud.](images/76421193/wSbSYvqGoD-daily.webp "")
