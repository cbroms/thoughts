Given the march towards [service-oriented design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_design) in the majority of the most successful new businesses, it seems fair to say that the future will continue to head in this direction.  

Uber and AirBnb are two particularly pertinent examples. So are Ebay, Spotify, Netflix, Google, on and on. 

A lot of what's proposed in the [Great Reset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset) seems to suggest the service model will dominate the future (assuming these guys pull off their plan for global domination.) 

But the vision isn't just services. It's centralized services that replace existing decentralized product/service mixes. It's having a fleet of self-driving cars that pick up food from restaurants and deliver them, as compared to a restaurant having a delivery driver with their own car. No need to own a car, or hire a driver. Just hire this service and the whole process is taken care of for you. 

If your goal is optimization, building services that spin up and down resources as needed is pretty ideal, so long as you have control of the entire process. If your business is delivery, you need to control *everything*, from the cars to the drivers (for now) to the routing algorithms. But that sort of business will be a relic; it's more efficient for the company with the fleet of self-driving cars to build the delivery service into its taxi service. Then it can optimize further: push restaurants near where a drop-off will be made in 30 minutes to the top of the app so the car doesn't have to sit idle for long before the order is ready. Control the unknowns as much as possible: try to influence behavior so users order from a specific restaurant since it's more efficient for the service. 

There's something about service design that feels pretty incredible when everything works out: it's a sort of orchestra passing one thing on to the next in a harmonious fashion. But [optimization] is not everything, sometimes adding a bit of [friction] is a good thing.
