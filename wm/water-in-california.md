[California](california.md) has quite a unique climate; mostly wet winter / dry summer. Water is a huge constraint. 

Drought is natural, millions of people living in drought-prone areas is not. 

Fewer people or desalination seem like the most viable solutions here. Of course, solutions that involve reworking our relationship with water in a much more fundamental way would be even more sustainable, but they go against [convention](conventions.md) and as a result seem less likely.
