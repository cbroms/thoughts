![Today was pretty nice. We woke up, then sat in bed talking until 11AM. Then I made some pancakes, and then we left and drove out to Pt. Reyes for a nice walk up past sky camp. Then we drove back, stopping very quickly over at my parents' house to pick up my new Amex card, then continued on our way. This evening we met up with, the game gang and played some games. One of the things we chatted about today on our walk was the goals we have for the age of 30. Mine were: - Be a landowner, - Have my own venture, - Be financially independent. Goal number one I think is pretty attainable. We're planning on hitting it hopefully before 25. The second goal is much more of a challenge. Having a business is one thing, but having a business that's somewhat stable is another. A business that's providing actual value to the world. That will take some real work, and we discussed the ways in which I've got to start acting on that pretty much now. The final goal I think is attainable. The minimum I'm saving now is $70k per year, and that should grow over the course of the next seven to eight years, ideally to over $100k per year. Just counting this salary that'd be a lean FIRE situation, which I count as a success. Obviously supplementing this with income from a business would cause much greater gains. If I want to be a millionaire, that's the only way it'd happen I think. To start my own business and provide value that way. Not a lot of time, gotta make this stuff happen!](images/00922954/zWCritWzsF-daily.webp "")
