I grew up in California and as a result suffer from a sort of blindness towards it. I can't really evaluate it in the same way I can other places; I just have too much of a personal tie to it. That goes for both the good and the bad. 

That said, I do think that living in California as an adult has exposed me to different aspects of the state that I wasn't exposed to as a kid and as a result somewhat shifted my perspective.
