![Nothing much to note today, just ready for the weekend. Actually, there is something I wanted to note. I decided that I'd try purchasing some Gold ETFs. I've been reading about diversification, and it seemed like gold is the thing to have in a strange sort of way. I was reading this analysis by some dude online (the best sort of analysis usually) who broke down the performance of a bunch of different portfolios and their asset allocations. He makes a pretty convincing case that there's value to holding a wide array of different assets, not only from a sanity sort of perspective, but also performance. It turned out that the best performing portfolio was something like: 20% Total stock index 20% Small cap value 20% Short term bonds 20% Long term bonds 20% Gold. Not only did this allocation result in nearly no long-term downturns (the longest was one year) but its performance was also constantly the best of all asset allocations. The author made the point that combinations of assets can behave in very unintuitive ways; you'd think that because gold tends to loose value and only 20% is allocated to the full stock market, gains would be relatively minor. But it's not the case, the different categories of assets interact with one another to produce gains that you wouldn't otherwise expect. He also made the point that you don't need this exact allocation to get the benefits. By including only 10% of long term bonds, SCV, and gold, it stabilizes your portfolio in quite a significant way. Reading some of the responses on MMM, it's clear that a lot of people have a real problem with gold, as in, they're never going to buy it for philosophical reasons. Evidently this is a Buffett thing too. Anyway, it made me realize that I really haven't developed my own philosophy on how I'd like to invest. I have bought into the index fund/ETF thing, but beyond that I don't really have many strong opinions about what's best. I feel like this is a pretty freeing thing at this point, because I don't have too much money yet. I can play around a little and develop my own intuition about things. Maybe I'll decide it was all a mistake and go back to the 100% VTI approach that I started with, or maybe this will work out for me. We'll see. 6:45PM / 65F I High of 67F / Sunny and mostly clear](images/50887146/UTIMOHmqZu-daily.webp "")
