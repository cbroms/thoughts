It's a general principle. If you can, do it. For the most part. 

There's a kind of [tendency to outsource work](https://nav.al/hourly-rate) that we're totally capable of doing. Saves time, they say. More time to become a creative person. More time to spend with family. Right. 

Clearly the time that's being saved not doing things by hand is-- for most at least--not being used to become a more creative person. That time's usually taken up by all sorts of entertaining things, [consumptive activities](consumption-and-creation.md). Not a bad thing, just a little inaccuracy that's told in service of streamlining and optimizing the many parts of our lives. 

The point, though, is not the time "saved" by outsourcing. Sure, using a dishwasher takes less time, it's hard to disagree with that. The point is what you *loose* by outsourcing. 

What you loose by outsourcing is hard to define. It's a feeling, deeply subjective, about finishing things. A hit of dopamine, a feeling of completeness. And that's just washing dishes by hand. When it comes to building things yourself, it compounds.

It's a bit like working in a [local-first](local-first.md) fashion. You're able to see and control more things around you, which makes you even more competent as a generalist. It's a goal of mine to continue to build more and more of the things I depend on, to [remove the dependencies](interdependence.md) on large and opaque external systems and depend on a smaller, more visible local systems.
