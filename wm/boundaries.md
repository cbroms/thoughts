As I've been writing my thoughts [here](one-dimension.md) over the last six months or so, It's become clearer to me where there's an implicit boundary between what I will and what I will not write about. 

The point of this project is to learn by exploring ideas through writing. I've done a lot of that. And I'm doing it [in public](working-in-public.md). That's part of the point. But the public-ness of it [is disturbing to me](disclaimer.md) too. 

So I have [a filter](filtering-expression.md). Here's what it turns out I filter out: 

- Ideas I encounter for the first time and haven't had time to ferment in my mind yet. 
- Topics that I don't really care about, but others talk about a lot because they're *in vogue* or made out to be highly controversial. 
- The people around me that I have a real relationship with. 
- Anything pertaining to my salaried job. 
- Ideas that I'm conflicted over. I try to explore [some of these](uncertainties.md), but there are others that I'm really not yet comfortable with (these usually fall into the category of things that haven't had a chance to ferment.)
