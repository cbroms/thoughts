I’m Christian.

This is [a collection of my notes](one-dimension.md), navigable through a series of bi-directional links.

I’m a [designer](the-craft-of-design.md); I [design](design.md) digital [tools](tools.md).

Much of my work is digital and lives on the [internet](the-internet.md); mostly [websites](my-websites.md) and recordings of [process](process.md). This system is an exploration into what happens when I take what's non-physical and non-recorded and turn it into a series of [digital artifacts](boundary-objects.md).

Everything I've written here is ephemeral. Despite the [weird authority](the-authority-of-writing.md) of the medium, don't fall for the illusion that what's written here is what I *believe*--it's just a snapshot in time. And who really knows what I believe? Not me. This is my best attempt at trying to record what the process of thinking is like, in [public](working-in-public.md).
