I’m Christian.

This is [a collection of my notes](one-dimension.md), navigable through a series of bi-directional links.

I’m a [designer](the-craft-of-design.md); I [design](design.md) digital [tools](tools.md).

About half of my work is digital and lives on the [internet](the-internet.md); mostly [websites](my-websites.md) and recordings of [process](process.md). This system is an exploration into what happens when I take what's non-physical and non-recorded and turn it into a series of digital artifacts.

Everything I've written here is ephemeral. Despite the [weird authority](the-authority-of-writing.md) of the medium, don't fall for the illusion that what's written here is a *position*--it's just a snapshot in time. And who really knows what I think? Not me. This is thinking on the fly, rough and imperfect. It's [unfiltered expression](filtering-expression.md). [Fuck it](fuck-it.md) man, let's make it [public](working-in-public.md).
