I’m [Christian](https://christianbroms.com).

This is [a collection of my notes](one-dimension.md), navigable through a series of bi-directional links.

I’m a [designer](design.md); I design digital [tools](tools.md).

About half of my work is digital and lives on the [internet](the-internet.md); mostly websites and [recordings of process](https://futureland.tv/christian). This system is an exploration into what happens when I take what's non-physical and non-recorded and turn it into a series of digital artifacts.

Everything I've written here is ephemeral. Recording it is a way of setting a rung to push up to the next rung; a way of building onwards from whatever's now. Despite the [weird authority of the medium](the-authority-of-writing.md), don't fall for the illusion that I still think in the same way as what's written here--it's a snapshot in time and nothing beyond that.
