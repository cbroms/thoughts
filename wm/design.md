*Design is the endeavor to conceive of future states that  diverge from the present with intention.*

It is, as far as I can tell, a uniquely human characteristic. I don't think there's a way for us to *stop* designing; it's our nature. It's the source of richness in our lives, what gives us the perpetual hope for the future. Design allows us to see beyond what's in front of us, to find better and more beautiful ways of living and thriving across nearly any state of the world. 

It's also why we'll most likely end our own existence.
