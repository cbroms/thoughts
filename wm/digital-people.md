I've taken to denoting digital people by writing "people" in quotes.

Digital people are fake people that real people create to interact with other "people" on the [internet](the-internet.md). 

It's a persona that takes on characteristics the real person doesn't have. For example, the "person" might feel more strongly about certain sorts of issues, speak in a certain way, act in a certain way, take on a certain tone, and so on. They become a product of the digital community they're a part of, often sunk deep within some version of a [clean culture](clean-culture.md). 

Digital people are what emerge when:

1. Expression is limited by the digital medium.
2. Expression is limited by strong top-down regulation forcing conformation to platform social standards. 
3. Expression is limited by strong bottom-up social pressures arising from the first two limitations.
