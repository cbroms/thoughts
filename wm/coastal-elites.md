Coastal elites. The laptop class. The enlightened class. 

When Sydney and I got our Bay Area tech jobs out of college, I started joking that we were going to be coastal elites. And that is what we are, sadly. 

This is a class of people that have strong views about right and wrong. Strangely conservative, yet liberal in their conservatism. They make a lot of money. They shop at Whole Foods. They fetishize tech. They fetishize nature. They love optimization.
