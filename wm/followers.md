It's a strange word, *followers*. 

Has it ever been used in a context beyond messiahs, cultists, and stalkers? Outside of its use in social media, that is. 

I know, calling attention to the words used in the technology industry is a bit of a cliche now (especially the classic "what other industry refers to their customers as *users* except tech and drugs?") But it is strange how prevalent the term became. Nearly every digital social system uses this concept of followers and following. 

The other day I found myself on [Foundation](https://foundation.app), an NFT marketplace. It's what, about a year old? This crypo stuff is incredibly new, and yet [their profiles](https://foundation.app/@CryptoGeometry) just recycle the same old following/follower relationship. It's like people just decided that if there's going to be some sort of social interaction in their system, it will be designed around followers. That followers are perhaps the manifestation of social interaction online. 

This is just pure laziness. Followers, I think it's fair to say, are a pretty weak framework for a social system. People just reuse it because it's familiar from the millions of other existing permutations of it. At least come up with a different word! Especially if you're marketing yourself as some sort of [manifestation of the creative zeitgeist](https://foundation.app/about).
