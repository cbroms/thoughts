I don't eat breakfast. 

Well, sometimes I do. I *really* like breakfast foods, especially  classic American diner food. Pancakes, hash browns, scrambled eggs, orange juice. Incredible stuff. Or even more incredible: Huevos Rancheros. Last time I was in [Ft. Bragg](trip-ft-bragg-2021.md) I had some fantastic Huevos Rancheros at a place called  Javvis Cafe. 

That's the other thing about breakfast; some of the coolest places you can go to eat are just open for breakfast and lunch. There's something about breakfast-only restaurants that have an excellent vibe. 

Even though I don't eat breakfast on most days, I do get the small pleasure of smelling breakfast cooking when I walk around the neighborhood in the morning. And that's the main thing; since the smell is so strongly associated with the start of a day it still has the same effect on me even if I don't eat it. An enjoyable moment whenever I get a whiff of bacon or coffee on a cold morning.
