*What is the simplest way to describe what a website is and how to make one?*

A website is a bundle of text, images, and code that can be interpreted by a web browser. 

You can make a website by: 
- Opening TextEdit or Notepad, or some similar program on your computer and creating a new document. 
- Typing "Hello"
- Saving it as a `.html` file, for example `website.html`. 
- Opening the file in your web browser. 

The only difference between this website and the websites you visit online is your website is a single file on your computer. When you visit `wikipedia.org`, you're requesting this file from Wikipedia's computers, which gets opened by your browser.
