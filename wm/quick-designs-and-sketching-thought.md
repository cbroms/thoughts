![As I was in a meeting today, I had an idea for a little bit of an interface that was based on some things that were being discussed. So I pulled off a post it note from the stack that's sitting on my desk and made a 10 second sketch of the idea for the UI. It's funny, I don't seem to often think about systems or UIs through sketching them out. I'll picture them in my head, and then I'll sit down and convert them into a mockup in Figma. That or I'll continue to think them over until it feels more ready to commit to digitally. But there was something really nice about making this little sketch. It captured the idea in a way that writing could not have, and took about ten seconds. It feels like it might be helpful for me to think more through sketching. Not just UIs, but other things too. Ideas. 10:35PM / 51F / High of 74F / Clear and sunny, then fog pushing in this evening.](images/45931474/WaqorqbIfu-daily.webp "")
