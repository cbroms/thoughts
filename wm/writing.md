Writing is flawed. It’s an imperfect medium to be sure. But still so _approachable_ compared to all the other [forms of expression](media.md).

I find myself fluctuating between writing in a particularly flowery, overly metaphorical way and writing in as direct and simple a way as possible. The metaphorical approach feels best when first formulating thoughts and sentences, the simple approach seems to emerge when I actually try to _read_ those sentences. Simple tends to prevail.

Of course that means plenty of thoughts or feelings won’t be well-expressed. I don’t think flowery metaphorical language gets any closer at expressing them than simple language, it just _feels_ like it does in the moment.

The goal is to find something in between, a style of writing that though terse, expresses something beyond the simplicity of the construction. Or, perhaps, complex construction that can be interpreted with ease. An [impossible contradiction](hypocrisy-and-contradiction.md), perhaps, but still the goal.
