<p>Writing is tough. I like it, but I also find it to be quite flawed. It’s an imperfect medium to be sure. But still so <em>easy</em> compared to <a href="media.md">everything else</a>. </p>
<p>I find myself fluctuating between writing in a particularly flowery, overly metaphorical way and writing in as direct and simple a way as possible. The metaphorical approach feels best when first formulating thoughts and sentences, the simple approach seems to emerge when I actually try to <em>read</em> those sentences. Simple tends to prevail. </p>
<p>Of course that means plenty of thoughts or feelings won’t be well-expressed. I don’t think flowery metaphorical language gets any closer at expressing them than simple language, it just <em>feels</em> like it does in the moment. </p>
<p>The goal is to find something in between, a style of writing that though terse, expresses something beyond the simplicity of the construction. Or, perhaps, complex construction that can be interpreted with ease. An <a href="hypocrisy-and-contradiction.md">impossible contradiction</a>, perhaps, but still the goal. </p>
