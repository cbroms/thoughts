It seems like often there's an notion that there isn't a right way to do things. People like to use the world *valid*. There are just so many *valid* ways to do things!

But it doesn't seem to be true. Often the space of possibilities narrows due to constraints. It seems like the problem is often people don't realize these constraints. Or they choose to ignore them. Either way, they arrive at a solution that's lackluster, that's missing something essential. They missed a key constraint, something that really did matter. 

Maybe there's a number of right ways to do things, but the point is that they're *right*. The constraints make them so. 

*This thought is classified [I don't know what I'm saying](fuck-it.md), hah.*
