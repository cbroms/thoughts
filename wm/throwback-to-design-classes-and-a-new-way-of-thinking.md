![Okay, I've decided it is time to get to work on that project I've mentioned before. I'm going to make something of concrete value, not just something because it's conceptually interesting to me. I need to change my thinking, to consider what I'm making in terms of more broad sorts of contexts. What is the little sliver of the world I can identify needs something new and It's already taking me back to college thinking about this sort of stuff. I remember taking Service Design and focusing. on this sort of value creation. Time to do it for real, hopefully I can figure it out. Well, I need to figure it out; this is a sort of design I need to master if I ever want to do something that's not just contributing to value-creation someone else figured out how to do. 8:10PM / 51F / High of 61F / Sunny and clear with a few clouds](images/16512320/RiQQTUdPNU-daily.webp "")
