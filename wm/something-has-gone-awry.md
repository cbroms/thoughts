Tonight I found myself in Chicago Midway airport eating a chicken sandwich while waiting for my connecting flight. 

I had 20 minutes to find something to eat, procure it, and eat it before boarding. So I ended up at this chicken sandwich... place. I tapped a touchscreen to place my order, and about three minutes later it was ready for me. 

As I sat at the gate eating this sandwich I could not help thinking that something was very much wrong. Here I was, in this horrible environment, eating this horrible food prepared in three minutes. Everything was the product of some vast supply chain of goods, miserable animals and people, and here I was a part of it. Looking like some sort of Martin Parr photograph, I thought to myself "this cannot be right." Something is very much wrong. This is not what it is like [to be a human](the-nature-of-something.md). 


*Something* has gone awry.
