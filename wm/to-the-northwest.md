![We're going to Seattle at the end of May. There have been some recent discussions around what we should do about the next year after we leave Berkeley, and where we should live. It seems like the Pacific Northwest is sort of the perfect place; it checks all the relevant boxes. So we figured we'd go up this summer and scout things out, look for some places we might want to live. I think the plan is to actually move up there next February, probably renting some AirBnbs for a month or so at a time. We're going to be *those* kind of people, I suppose. Really looking forward to this first trip. 10:00PM / 55F / High of /68F / Clear and sunny](images/74918471/nBZLVzooYt-daily.webp "")
