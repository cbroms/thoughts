![Yesterday morning I successfully baked a couple of leaves of bread. It's been quite a while since I was able to get the oven spring right, and the loaves yesterday were bigger than I've made in a long time. The second one even grew so tall it hit the top of the dutch oven! The key, I think, is that the bulk fermentation has to go a bit longer than I've been letting it. This time I waited until the dough got really light and airy. I think whenI start to feel like I need to be careful and not deflate it, that's about the time to take it out and do the shaping. I'm going to make some more loaves later this week to ensure that I've really got the correct technique down before moving on to more exotic types of bread. But I have to say, getting it right after messing up so often for a while feels really good. Especially considering I haven't actually made a good loaf of bread in this house yet, and we've been here since July. Today I've set aside pretty much the whole day for weekend projects. There are three main things I want to work on today: 1) Figure out how to display these typewritten notes on One Dimension. If you're reading this there, I've figured that out. 2) Rework the styling of One Dimension a bit. As with anything you continue to add to organically over time, it starts to get a bit cluttered and all over the place. I want to bring back a bit more cohesion. 3) Establish the underlying data structure to represent browsing through a set of tabs for Hyperfov. I worked on this a bit last weekend, but didn't actually test it, and after thinking about it again, I think I can do better. If I can go through those three things I'll be satisfied at the end of the day to be sure. There are a couple other gardening related things I'd also like to get to, but we'll see if I have time. That's all for today! typing is starting to feel a bit better. 9:30AM / 52F / High of 63F / Clear](images/81455688/NDhAEEmsrU-daily.webp "")
