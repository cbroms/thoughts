- Locavore-friendly counter-serve chain specializing in organic salads, soup & bowls.
- Cozy counter-serve setup putting a healthy spin on poke bowls, curries & other Japanese dishes.
- Charming, industrial-chic bakery & vegan deli for pastries, coffee & creative vegetable-based mains.
- Chinese restaurant with a chic, modern atmosphere & a menu that offers Peking duck & other classics.
- Elegant outpost serving a modern Japanese izakaya menu with California & global influences.
- Socially conscious pie parlor showcases specialty pizzas, a full bar & live bands in a funky space.
- Bustling counter-serve destination for hearty salads & sandwiches served in friendly environs.
- Long-running (since 1977) shop, open late, offering frozen yogurt in simple digs.
- Italian deli & market offering housemade pasta, imported cheese, charcuterie & more in homey digs.

I never get quite as annoyed as when I read these damn things. Why is everything *chic*? What is a *locavore*? Why is it an *outpost*? *Environs*? *digs*??

Someone definitely writes these things. Some poor person sifts through reviews and photos and pulls out the Google Millennial-approved list of adjectives and just starts throwing them together to get... something. 

This would be a pretty good set of data you could train a markov chain on and get a bunch of absolutely flawless results. That sounds pretty fun actually, I might give it a shot.
