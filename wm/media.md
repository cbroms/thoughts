It's strange how the medium of video is so often tied to [consumption](consumption-and-creation.md) in the most negative ways, while engaging with text or audio is seen as somehow more noble. I'm *reading a book*. Imagine that. 

I certainly enjoy watching videos and listening to music. I don't really read many [books](books.md), and I'm fine with that. I'll read one every now and then, but for the most part I like to [write](writing.md) instead. 

Anyway, here are some of the things I've been consuming as of late: 

### Audio 

- Lots of music. I keep [a log of what I find to be the best song of the day](https://futureland.tv/christian/best-song-of-the-day/grid). 
    - Deafheaven. An absolutely phenomenal band that has created some of the [most emotionally charged](the-most-poignant-song.md) songs Iâ€™ve [heard](infinite-granite-live.md).
    - Toro y Moi. Discovered this guy from my high school photography teacher who played [a music video of his](https://youtu.be/gGmfOsdla2Y) once during class. When I got home I totally forgot the name of the artist and tried searching for keywords from the video until I finally found it (guy casually pulling aside fern frond music video?)
    - The War on Drugs. Consistently incredible. So many of their tracks are associated with [particular places](music-and-places.md) for me. 
- The Lex Fridman Podcast. I listen to this when I commute to work. A wide range of guests engaging in quite compelling discussions with a most excellent host.

### Video Games 

Can't beat an occasional [video game](video-games.md). 

- Battlefield 4. Playing this for a few hours on the weekend is incredibly relaxing.
- [Mini Motorways](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127500/Mini_Motorways/). Incredibly chill.
