A few things I’ve been [consuming](consumption-and-creation.md) as of late:

- _Infinite Granite_ by Deafheaven. An absolutely phenomenal band that has created some of the [most emotionally charged](the-most-poignant-song.md) songs I’ve heard.
- The Lex Fridman Podcast. I listen to this when I commute to work. A wide range of guests engaging in quite compelling discussions with a most excellent host, Lex.
