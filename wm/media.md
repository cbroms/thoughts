<p>A few things I’ve been <a href="consumption-and-creation.md">consuming</a> as of late:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Infinite Granite</em> by Deafheaven. An absolutely phenomenal band that has created some of the <a href="the-most-poignant-song.md">most emotionally charged</a> songs I’ve heard. </li>
<li>The Lex Fridman Podcast. I listen to this when I commute to work. A wide range of guests engaging in quite compelling discussions with a most excellent host, Lex.</li>
</ul>
