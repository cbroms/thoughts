A few things I’ve been [consuming](consumption-and-creation.md) as of late:

### Audio 

- _Infinite Granite_ by Deafheaven. An absolutely phenomenal band that has created some of the [most emotionally charged](the-most-poignant-song.md) songs I’ve heard. The album worked better [live](infinite-granite-live.md) in places. 
- The Lex Fridman Podcast. I listen to this when I commute to work. A wide range of guests engaging in quite compelling discussions with a most excellent host.

### Video Games 

Can't beat an occasional [video game](video-games.md). 

- Battlefield 4. Playing this for a few hours on the weekend is incredibly relaxing. 
- [Mini Motorways](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127500/Mini_Motorways/). Incredibly chill.
