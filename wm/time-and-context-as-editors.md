Often, It'll get towards the end of the day and I'll start writing down a few notes [here](one-dimension.md). I'll have been mulling over something all day, and I dump those thoughts down then go to sleep. 

The next day, I'll think back to what I wrote the night before and almost always feel that how I expressed the thought was too severe, too absolute. I'll come back and change the language a bit, or maybe reformulate the thought altogether.

The same is true when I'm listening to a particular type of music as I write. Writing listening to [Deafheaven](the-most-poignant-song.md) results in a very different thought than writing listening to Toro y Moi. 

*Time* helps flesh out thoughts, give them more context and forces you to see them in a new light.  

*Context* changes how the thought is formulated on a more fundamental level.
