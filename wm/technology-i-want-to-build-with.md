Sense a pattern?  

I have not actually developed with any of these decentralization-related technologies. I think the challenge is that I don't yet think in their language and therefore don't have ideas for how to build with them. Since I think  in a more traditional web language, all my ideas manifest with traditional technologies. 

It seems like a good first step would be to develop something super simple with one of them that starts to get me thinking in a different language.
