Watching David Lynch's [weather reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNXFdo2VnGU) around the weekend, he's sure to mention "weekend projects." 

It's a pretty reliable constant--every weekend we're getting started, working on, and finishing up our weekend projects. I love this! 

It makes the weekend an exciting thing to look forward to, it's  productive and personal. I've always enjoyed my weekend projects, usually some kind of [website-related endeavor](twelve-websites.md) these days. When I was a kid I'd build WWII model airplanes and would spend hours putting them together and painting them over the weekends. There's something nice about this, it's a kind of holy time to yourself in which you can be creative in your own personal way. You're free to create without worrying about work or school. 

There's also the notion that it's a bounded amount of time; these are projects that are done on the side, hobbies perhaps. Nothing too serious. Just the right mix of time, creativity, and enjoyability.
