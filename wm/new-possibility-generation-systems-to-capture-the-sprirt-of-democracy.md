Often it seems like voting is thought of as some sort of magic potion that turns a non-democratic process into a democratic one. 

But it's not so. Voting is just one part of a much larger system, that, when put together yields a democratic process. As I wrote in my thought about [DAOs](daos.md): 

> Here we run into a problem that spans beyond just DAOs--it's a problem with voting *as a mechanism* more broadly. Consider:

> But I'd argue the real power rests not in the voters, but in who creates the proposals. The authors of proposals A and B have the most power: they're reducing down the space of possible proposals down to just two. By the time the vote happens the real decisions have already been made. 

Voting is simply a mechanism for deciding from one of a number of possibilities. What those possibilities are isn't determined by the mechanism. And as many have lamented about the U.S. political system, often the choices that are presented to the voter are varying shades of bad. Maybe the system is technically democratic, but it doesn't necessary capture the *spirit of democracy*. For that, we need decision-making systems like voting, paired with *possibility-generation systems*. 

Possibility-generation systems are much more nebulous. They are perhaps best described as 'crowdsourced [design](design.md)'. The goal being to simply a possibility space into a few well-considered options, and doing so as a representative group, not just an elite cabal. 

What do the possibility-generation systems of the future look like?
