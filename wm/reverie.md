Some days, like today, are just too excellent. There's something I read in *Walden* that stuck with me as a perfect descriptor for these sorts of days:

>  Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveller's wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better than any work of the hands would have been. They were not time subtracted from my life, but so much over and above my usual allowance. I realized what the Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of works. For the most part, I minded not how the hours went. The day advanced as if to light some
work of mine; it was morning, and lo, now it is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished.

Some days I feel like that--like I'm rapt in a reverie. The sun shines down, the breeze is cool, the temperature is just so. It's impossible not to contemplate, to sit and do nothing but think, if even that. To simply soak up the day.
