Went to my first Deafheaven concert, and it was quite a different experience than I was expecting. Some of the songs off the new album worked really well live; the feel of them translated into an incredible experience back and forth between soft and intense waves. *Villain*, *The Gnashing*, and *Mombasa* were all quite powerful. Some of the other songs were a bit muddled as a consequence of some iffy technical stuff. 

They finished out with *Honeycomb*, *Brought to the Water*, and *Dream House*. The last two songs were probably some of the best they played, with *Brought to the Water* hitting  all the perfect notes. Clarke has quite a captivating stage presence; the screaming parts are totally worth seeing live if nothing else. 

Looking forward to seeing them again.
