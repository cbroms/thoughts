- 50g Zante Currants
- 340g Flour
- 1½ tsp Baking powder
- ½ tsp Baking soda
- ¼ cup Sugar
- ½ tsp Salt
- ½ cup Unsalted Butter
- ¾ cup Buttermilk
- ½ tsp Lemon Zest

Let the currants soak in warm water for 10 minutes or so. 

Mix the dry ingredients. Add the butter and cut in with a pastry cutter until the butter is pea-sized. 

Add the buttermilk, zest, and currants. Mix until just combined,  then turn out onto a cutting board and shape into a log about 6" wide. Cut into triangles.

Place the triangles on a lined baking sheet and bake at 400F for 30 minutes.
