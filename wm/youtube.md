I can't think of any better example of the very best and very worst the modern [internet](the-internet.md) has to offer than YouTube. 

On one hand it's an extraordinary place. I've found so much joy in exploring and learning from the [incredibly creative people](media.md) that use YouTube as a place to share their work. I have no problem saying that what I have seen on the site has shaped a big part of who I am and what I do today. I think many young people today would agree. 

On the other hand, YouTube is an absolutely horrible place. The vast majority of videos are garbage pumped out by ["people"](digital-people.md) who simply *don't give a shit*. The algorithmic recommendation system silos people into ever more specific boxes. The top-down moderation is often appallingly heavy-handed and conservative in service of maintaining a corporate [liberally-normative culture](clean-culture.md).
