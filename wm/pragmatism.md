I tend to try and think in the most pragmatic way possible. 

What will happen if we take this action? What about this other action? Our *understanding* of the outcomes *is* the reality in a way, as it's what we use to come to a decision. The information we have is all we have. 

There's probably a more rigorous way to define it, but that's how I think about it. 

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism):

> Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that considers words and thought as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving, and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.
