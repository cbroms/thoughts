It's amazing how much everything we've built hides the truth of the world from us. With more complexity the further we get from the essential [nature of things](the-nature-of-something.md). 

Much of what we think of as *improvement* is a step back. It pushes us into our own internal manufactured worlds, into *the make believe*. 

And so we turn everything beyond us, everything non-human into *the other*. We call it nature. It's often in our way; a dangerous and chaotic place to be tamed. Or it's something to be fetishized, to turn into surface-level pornography as some strange anthropomorphized being *mother nature*. It's bizarre. 

Our relationship with nature is tending towards being more and more retarded. The fact that we even consider ourselves separate from it is insane. We obsess over what is *man-made* from what is *natural*. The separation isn't a physical one--it's a mental one! We're all the same stuff, it's just that our internal worlds have been so tightly bound, so squeezed into a particular shape that we can't help but see things in terms of two separate worlds. Human and nature. Order and chaos. Not so!

*We're* nature, it's all one thing.
