![I lost at least two ideas today. I know I had some things I wanted to write down while I was at work, but I forgot to. I didn't have my notebook with me today, and as soon as I thought of the ideas I thought to myself "I should write this down in my phone" but didn't of course. Every time I write something down in my phone I never revisit it. So I make excuses and think I'll just remember it. Which *never* happens. Maybe I really just need to bring my notebook with me more often to avoid incidents like this. I'm going to end a bit early this evening as I'm working on my 1D experiment and want to continue the momentum. If I could have the Figma pretty much done tonight that'd be ideal. 8:55PM / 55F / High of 65F / Sunny, some haze the whole day](images/31186103/FQjZFoXziX-daily.webp "")
