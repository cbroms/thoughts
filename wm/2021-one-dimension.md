As of December 31, 2021, [One Dimension](one-dimension.md) has a total of:

```text
136 thoughts
283 links
29,175 words
```

I started writing nearly daily on September 12, so that's an average of 1.23 thoughts and 263 words per day. 

I'm excited to keep it up, as I feel that writing in this interconnected way has generally increased my ability to make new connections while [writing](writing.md), thinking, and reading. I have an increasingly larger body of thoughts to pull from in order to form more interesting new directions and [futures](futures.md). 

The last commit of 2021 is `7c710aa96952716bdb7c4d8455440e7a415019c3`.
