There's an immense amount of satisfaction I get out of working with my hands. 

Every time I take on some little task in [the garden](garden.md), I finish feeling much better than I started. There's something about changing [the environment around you](local-first.md) in a tangible way that feels innately satisfying. It's why whenever I get the opportunity to build something myself, I do. 

I think it's a pretty key part of [how to live](how-to-live.md).
