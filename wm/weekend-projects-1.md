![It's Friday, which seems like a good day to use to plan out what weekend projects I'd like to work on in the next two days. Here's what I'd like: 1) Build the history visualization on One Dimension. Basically what I've done so far is created a new history directory that stores copies of each file when new changes are made. So I have a list of files like this: 2021-12-03, 2022-01-12, 2022-02-04 and so on. Each page should have a little diagram that summarizes the changes in a way that makes clear the amount of time that has passed between each change. I'm thinking something like this: (diagram) 2) Finish the page previews package I've been working on for the last couple weekends. It's really close to being done and just needs some finishing touches to feel nice and polished with some light animations and optimization. The documentation is pretty much done. Those seem to me like fairly achievable goals, especially if I get most of Sunday to work through them. Finishing them will mean I'll have completed everything I wanted to work on in the hear term that's not directly Hyperfov, which should open me up to start working on the project again. Looking forward to these weekend projects. 8:50AM / 47F / High of 63F / Clear](images/65537825/IzsyYTLLJT-daily.webp "")
