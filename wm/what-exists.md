Things that exist in our heads are very real, in some ways more so than the real we accept to be real.

Maybe I see a bear near where I'm camping for the night. This tells me that the bear exists; it's something that makes sense to think about and change my behavior.

But maybe no bear exists, I never see it. But I hear something at night, a crashing in the bushes. In my head that bear very much exists. There's probably no "actual" bear, but my behavior changes. Both events are the same _functionally_.
