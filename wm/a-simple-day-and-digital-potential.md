![Short page today, I think. Spent most of the day just hanging out at home and talking with Sydney. Then we walked up a bit of the way to the top of the hills behind Berkeley. Then we went home and I resumed my work on my button website, which, by the way, now has a name: button.land. It's coming along, but I really need to nail down the design, as at the moment it's a real mess. We talked a lot today about interactive websites that present information through little visual examples. I think they're a really powerful alternative to purely text-based layouts of information, or even simple adding in a few diagrams. No, this is a totally different approach, one that allows the reader to make the discoveries for themselves, rather than needing to follow somebody's terribly written explanation.I tend to think this is one of those untapped potential areas that needs to be explored. People just haven't truly seen what's possible in a digital medium, everything is really just paper 2.0. We need something truly new! So many projects I keep getting into… Fantastic day today. Super clear, nice cool breeze, lots of sun. A few nice cumulus clouds on the horizon. That perfect spring weather. Bit too much going on today to mark it down as a reverie day. 9:10PM / 48F / High of 58F / Sunny, some afternoon clouds](images/40711699/yfWnPbrCaB-daily.webp "")
