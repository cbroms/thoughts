The process of [society](society.md) becoming less [interdependent](interdependence.md). But not necessarily halting [progress](progress.md). 

I am intrigued. This seems to be the trend what with the realities of a connected world only really starting to sink in now that they've been put to the forefront. I imagine we'll continue to see the testing of these ties, and cutting of them. 

An exciting new avenue, most certainly.
