Working thoughts on the topic. 

- Streams should emerge naturally from the text of the entry while youâ€™re composing it
- Journals and entries should both have streams
- Need to figure out how to suggest stream names based on of user typed in entry vs journal 
- For journals, add streams in setting or something with search 
- Journal is a bit more traditional, entry is a bit more organic and fluid 
- In close notation, use search to find stream related to text
