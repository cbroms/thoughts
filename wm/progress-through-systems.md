One random heuristic for [progress](progress.md) popped into my head the other day:  

> You'll know if you're moving in the right direction if *you*  build more and more of the systems you interact with day-to-day. 

This applies to digital, physical, and cultural [systems](systems.md). Why waste time living with the less-than-ideal systems that are built by others? 

There's a circle of things I can control, and everything I can't. The fact is I have quite a lot of control over the systems I work with day-to-day, even if it doesn't seem like it. A [house](building-a-house.md), for example, is one big system for life that should be designed in just the right way, not taken off a store shelf because that's just how it is. No, let's think it through. The same is true for digital systems; why settle when I have the capability to build something better. And if I don't have the capability, I can learn. 

The systems we surround ourselves with are incredibly important, let's not just take what's tossed our way.
