Sydney and I decided we'd spend the weekend up in the redwoods, because, well, why not. We were recently back from our [Eastern Sierra trip](trip-eastern-sierra-2021.md), and figured we could fit in another nice weekend away before the end of the year. 

So, we drove up to Ft. Bragg one Friday afternoon. We came over S.R. 20, which was about 30 miles of remote, winding road through the redwoods. Dusk had just fallen and the fog dropped low across the ground, resulting in a very dark and wet sort of vibe what with all the recent rain. 

We had dinner at a minuscule Thai place in Ft. Bragg with a single proprietress and one other pair of old guys sitting right next to us who spent the whole time discussing the this-and-thats of buying used cars, local radio, their adult children, and local gossip. The restaurant was just quiet enough that speaking at nearly any volume would surely result in the guys next to us hearing everything, so we stayed silent throughout and passively listened to them, pretending to not be. We left and immediately started analyzing their lives and psychology. It was a most excellent time.  

We spent the night in some motel, where we continued watching Twin Peaks, a show that we'd started the trip before and was now cemented in my mind as an *old motel* sort of show. 

The next morning we got breakfast at an excellent Mexican diner sort of place, then drove down to Mendocino and went for a hike in Russian Gulch State Park.

I realized I'd been on the hike before quite a few years ago when we spent the new year in someone's cabin up there. Strange déjà vu. 

Then we went into Mendocino and admired its touristy historicness in a semi-ironic kind of way. After that, we went back up to Ft. Bragg and took a walk around some tidepools.

By then it was pretty much dark, so we had diner at a Mexican place and went back to the hotel to dip back into the world of Twin Peaks. The next morning, we were up and out back home.
