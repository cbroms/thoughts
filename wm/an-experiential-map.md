What would a map look like if the goal were to capture experience? Or perhaps layers of experience over physical space? 

One 'easy' example that comes to mind is the weather. I'd like a map I can use to understand the climate of different areas. You get a sense for this from the vegetation in satellite view, but that doesn't tell you much about cloud cover, seasonality, temperature variation, wind, and so on. These are qualities of a place that are *experienced*. How might they be transmitted as a layer of information overlaid on terrain?
