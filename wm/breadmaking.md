I've been making bread since 2016 or so. I generally make a country style loaf with a natural leaven.

The recipe I usually use is very simple:

- 800g water
- 1000g flour (mostly white with a variable amount of whole wheat)
- 200g leaven
- 20g salt

The real trick is the process, which is one of those things that can vary a lot day to day and takes some experimentation. What works one day may not work the next because the temperature is different, or starter, or timing. I think it’s more about having a sense for what variables to change based off the way the dough is feeling and going from there. Every time I start making bread again after stopping for a while I have to go through the process of relearning because of the huge variability; it’s really about having the experience to know how best to proceed.
