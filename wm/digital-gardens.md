When I originally started working on [One Dimension](one-dimension.md), I'd heard about digital gardens, but hadn't really explored them. The more I've looked closer, the more it seems that classifying this site as a kind of "digital garden" wouldn't be too inaccurate. 

Here are a few examples I've been perusing: 

- [Johannes Klingebiel](https://johannesklingebiel.de/wiki/index.html)

- [This massive list of more](https://github.com/KasperZutterman/Second-Brain), and [this one too](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked)

From [sentiers.media](https://sentiers.media/dispatch-08-digital-gardens/), a digital garden is:

- Thoughtful
- Compact
- Heavily linked
- Has backlinks
- Has transclusions
- Editable
