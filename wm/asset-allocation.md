So far my thinking about asset allocation has shifted a couple times, and will undoubtedly shift again many times. 

When I first got started investing, I was of the mindset that I'd choose a variety of sector ETFs, focusing mainly on technology. Then I started reading about FIRE, and the primary approach advocated there was to stick everything in a total stock market ETF or index fund. More recently I've started exploring investing forums more deeply, and have learned a bit more about the unintuitive ways different asset classes can interact with one another to produce outsized returns with lower volatility. There's some really nice [examples of this on Portfoliocharts](https://portfoliocharts.com/2021/12/16/three-secret-ingredients-of-the-most-efficient-portfolios/). 

So, my current target asset allocation looks like this:

- 60% Total Stock Market (VTI)
- 10% Small Cap Value (VBR)
- 10% Real Estate (VNQ)
- 10% Gold (SGOL)
- 5% Short-Term Bonds (VGSH)
- 5% Long-Term Bonds (VGLT)
