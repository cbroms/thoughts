![Pretty productive day. Lots of meetings (Design reviews) at work, then catching up on FL stuff in the evening. I did end up breaking and working on button.land. I know I said I wouldn't until this sunday, but for some reason I've been struggling to make progress on this interactive article thing. I worked on it a bit this week, but I'm not entirely sure what to do next. Iâ€™ve never worked on a project like this before, so it's not clear to me how it will come together. Broadly, the idea is to figure out what makes a system feel quick and responsive. Since this project is so concerned with the *feeling* of the system, I think an important part of it will be actually making the little interactive thing. Actually, yeah, this makes sense. The first step should be to start playing around with the laggy feeling tool itself, or making it rather. Make the basic checkbox with image reveal, then try out different intervals before revealing the image. I guess it would be simpler if I just draw it out. So that's the general idea. I've been feeling stuck on this thing because I've been thinking of it in terms of the writing component, which I don't have figured out conceptually. But I think given the fact that the point of this thing is to experiment with the more interactive part of it, I should just start with that and see where it takes me. I probably won't work on this tomorrow or saturday, so seems like the thing to be doing sunday morning. The goal: make an interface that feels laggy AF. I can do that. 9:50PM / 49F / High of 61F / Some high clouds all day, lots of moisture in the air.](images/88024560/xrezevOijF-daily.webp "")
