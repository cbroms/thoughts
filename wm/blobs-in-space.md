Blobs exist in a vast space, devoid of any light or external forces. 

These blobs are soft, pliable. They're a bit puffy. They're all stationary in space, a group of co-blobs, blogging. They bounce a bit, rearing to go. And then suddenly they're shot out, *flung*, into space with a particular trajectory with their co-blobs. 

And so they speed off into space. They roll over and swoosh here and there, enjoying the freedom of space and their place in it. Suddenly, a blob from the group smashes into some unseen object, flattening against it and receding behind the group. It's so fast the blobs barely even notice that their group is one fewer. 

So the blobs continue, onwards on their trajectory. Again, though, a member of the group hits an unseen object, this time spinning out of control and into the group of blobs, hitting a few others off course. Off their trajectories, these blobs bound off more unseen objects, rattling them here and there. These objects leave imprints in the soft blobs, pushing them out of shape. Having hit more than one of these objects, a blob became patterned with hits, a unique blend of lines and dents in its otherwise blobby shape. 

Now more and more of the blobs are hitting objects, some stopping altogether and others flinging off in different directions. Some of the blobs absorb the hits and seem to puff right back up, their blobbiness intact, while others are left with gashes and deep imprints from these objects. 

Having hit a few objects, the blobs begin to develop a sense for them. The objects are no longer unseen; they're made out just barely as they grow nearer. Some blobs realize this and fling themselves out of the way as the object shoots by, just missing it. 

A few of the blobs have had it quite rough. Having hit an object and bounced off their path, they hit another, and another. Each hit spins them off into a different direction, colliding with some other object on and on. Some of these blobs keep moving, trying to avoid the oncoming objects. Others don't, letting themselves slam again and again into object after object. 

Some of the blobs have been luckier. They haven't hit any objects at all. They've watched as their co-blobs have been hit and spun off course, but they haven't moved or been hit at all. Like their co-blobs, some of them start to sense the objects and maneuver their way around, but others just stay put and fly along without worry: they won't be hitting any objects. 

This is the life of the blobs, flying through space, grazing, bouncing off, swinging around objects to varying degrees. Eventually, though, each blob *will* hit an object that will bring them to a stop. This is the way it must be. How each blob gets to that point is as unique as the pattern of hits across their blob-self, but they all eventually collide for one last time. So it is.
