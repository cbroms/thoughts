I'm not a millennial, but I do love kale. 

All the kale I've planted so far in this garden has been [directly in the ground](direct-planting-vegetables.md), which has worked out well. 

I'm growing [Lacinato Kale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacinato_kale), [Red Russian](https://specialtyproduce.com/produce/Red_Russian_Kale_5959.php), and what appears to be something called [KX-1](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/kale/kx-1-f1-kale-seed-4009.html).

I also got a variety called [Richmond's Pride](https://www.anniesannuals.com/plants/view/?id=3600), which has turned out to grow quite well here.
