The experience of growing [bok choi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_choy) has been a bit iffy so far. I started them in trays and transplanted when they had just a couple of leaves.

They grew fairly well over the winter into nice baby bok choi sized plants, but now that the weather has warmed up just a bit they've all bolted.

Maybe it's the warm weather that's caused it, but I'd like to try again in a month or so and see how they'll do when there's less temperature variance.
