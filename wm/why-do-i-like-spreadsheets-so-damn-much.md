![My only real thought for today was to try and figure out why it is that I love spreadsheets so much. I've recently been getting really into making spreadsheets for different things I'm tracking, like finances and stuff related to One Dimension. Itâ€™s incredibly satisfying coming back after a month and inputting some new values into a spreadsheet I've already set up. All the calculations rerun as I enter everything in, as do the charts and whatnot. It's incredible! I get excited thinking about coming back next month and doing the same thing again. It seems like a big part of it is that the spreadsheet is something that reveals itself over time. As more data is added, a story starts to emerge. You set up all the formulas and charts in anticipation of learning something, and time passing slowly uncovers the story. It is itself an investment in that sense; the real rewards come with time. Perhaps the most obvious thing that sets spreadsheet apart is the design of the tool itself. It's so damn simple. A giant grid of inputs. Rows, columns, emerge. The structure is up to you. Even more miraculously, the whole thing is programmable. Any sort of computation or transformation you can imagine can be applied. Just learn the basics of the language and you're on your way. It's visual; rather than manipulating tables in your head and writing code in this purely mental representation, a spreadsheet allows you to actually see the columns, rows, and values you're interacting with. The results of your formulas are applied in an instant. It feels so natural. I'd break down the key components like this: 1) A spreadsheet is an abstraction that applies just the right combination of constraints. Too many constraints and the tool feels limited, too few and it also feels limited in that you can't come up with ways of interacting with it. 2) A rich and native system of interaction. Once you've put your data in a spreadsheet, it becomes easy to imagine the transformations you'll want to apply to yield a particular result. The abstraction suggests patterns of interaction. Everything else just helps make the process of interacting with the tool that much simpler. But the main thing seems to be that the abstraction is just right. 5:50PM / 58F / High of 67F / Mostly sunny, some high clouds](images/10691982/BiKzyoOSPV-daily.webp "")
