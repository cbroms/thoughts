Today as I was driving to work--as I do once a week--I was listening to the [Lex Fridman podcast](lex-fridman.md). As the guest was speaking, I found myself able to predict how Lex would respond to the guest's point. 

It's extremely weird to think about, that I'm able to know how someone would respond to a point I'd never heard before, and that I'd never met or interacted with that person. I only listen to the podcast once a week for about an hour, yet over that time I was able to develop an intuition for the way the host thinks and responds to ideas. 

It's this strange digital relationship. The same sort you get with streamers. The audience *feels* like they know the streamer because they've spent hours watching them, but they've never actually interacted with them.
