We don't choose the conditions in which we grow up. 

The values that are instilled in us are not values *we've* come to decide are worthy, but are instead values from the environment around us. 

Sometimes it seems like people are *very much* a product of their environment. Seen together, it often makes complete sense that a particular person is a particular way because of the context around them. You can draw the connections between how they are and the forces that seem to have shaped them. Seeing someone in their parents' home makes this very clear. 

So, to a certain extent, we're all brainwashed. But this brainwashing often doesn't seem like brainwashing. I feel like the values I hold *make sense*. But the reason I have these values is not entirely due to my own choices. It feels important to remember.
