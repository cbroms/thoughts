Yesterday I made [a big boy purchase](big-boy-purchases.md). 

I bought a typewriter. It's an Olympia SM9 Deluxe.

I figured if I'm going to [write](writing.md) I should experience writing in all its forms. I've written by hand quite a lot in college, and on a computer, but not in the now-mostly-forgotten in-between: with a typewriter. 

I don't really have any expectations. We'll see if I end up enjoying it, but regardless I will definitely learn something from the process. 

I'm going to start a daily practice of writing something on the typewriter and putting it up here.
