![I've been having these very linear dreams recently where there's a kind of distinguishable narrative to the dream. The one I had today was about a long and complicated trip to and from a series of locations on the east coast and ending in Wisconsin. Of course there were surreal elements to it, but for the most part it was quite intelligible. The dream ended in my retelling the story of the trip to some characters in the dream, so I revisited it before I woke up and everything was fresher than it otherwise would have been. There's a strange sensation I've noticed quite a lot where as I'm starting to wake up I become aware that I'm waking up while still in a dream, and I make a conscious effort to return to the dream or cement it in my memory before waking up and loosing it. It's no wonder people are so fascinated by dreaming. There's just so much about the experience that breaks from the "normal" and makes it much a mysterious process. I remember a debate in a class I was taking about if you are unconscious or not when you're asleep. The discussion unfolded, and the class was pretty mixed about it. Some felt that you were unconscious in part of your sleep, and in other parts you were more conscious. Others felt that the entire thing should either be considered conscious or unconscious, a few positing that there's not really KKK any such thing as unconsciousness, just a kind of gradient of consciousness. In the end, the professor had us raise our hands if we dreamed. Everyone who argued you were in some state of consciousness when you were asleep raised their hands. Everyone who didn't dream felt the opposite. It really does go to show how much personal experience dictates perspective. This class had established a fairly rigorous definition of consciousness, so the difference did not come from a difference of definition, but rather something about the difference of experience. One side effect of writing these morning pages has been that I've become more aware of how noisy my head is in the morning. I wake up and I'm thinking; it feels like perhaps the busiest part of the day for thoughts. While that's going on I've got the last song I was listening to from the day before on repeat in my head, and I'm also trying to think about the day and make plans. I sit down and start writing. It's definitely the case that doing some writing helps this, but I still feel like I could use some slowing of the mind at this point in the day. Anyway, I think I might start some mediation and see what happens. 8:00AM / 46F / High of 59F / Clear and dry](images/79586047/qLrmGFBjIZ-daily.webp)
