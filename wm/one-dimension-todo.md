- Links to nonexistent thoughts
- Renaming thoughts
- ~~Improve search~~
  - ~~Case-insensitive search~~
  - ~~Put matching filenames at the top~~
  - ~~Ignore directories~~
  - ~~Fix scrolling in the editor search panel~~
- ~~Sort changelog by date~~
- ~~Image support~~
  - ~~For editor (drag and drop)~~
  - ~~For API (copy file to new directory, replace link)~~
- ~~Cancelling saving results in a null filename~~
- Backlinks link to specific sections of text. Linked text can also backlink to the link that linked it lol. Instead of pages linking together, it's elements linking together. Something a bit like [text fragments](https://web.dev/text-fragments/).
- Pasting a `.md` filename in the editor search should open the file by default rather than showing search results
- Lists in excerpts should be converted to a comma separated list, where each `li` gets a comma appended. If possible, end the `ul` or `ol` with a period?
- Add indication of number of page connections to each link. Helps get a sense for where in the network you're moving to (towards a highly-connected node, or away)
- Assign each thought a randomly generated visual, ideally inheriting from a highly-connected set of neighbors
- Visual "map" of the overall structure
- Save `wm` to object storage as a backup
- ~~Add an index for blog-like pages~~
