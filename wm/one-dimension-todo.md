- Links to nonexistent thoughts
- Renaming thoughts
- ~~Improve search~~
  - ~~Case-insensitive search~~
  - ~~Put matching filenames at the top~~
  - ~~Ignore directories~~
  - ~~Fix scrolling in the editor search panel~~
- ~~Sort changelog by date~~
- Image support
  - For editor (drag and drop)
  - For API (copy file to new directory, replace link)
- ~~Cancelling saving results in a null filename~~
- Backlinks link to specific sections of text. Linked text can also backlink to the link that linked it lol. Instead of pages linking together, it's elements linking together. Something a bit like [text fragments](https://web.dev/text-fragments/). 
- Pasting a `.md` filename in the editor search should open the file by default rather than showing search results
- Lists in excerpts should be converted to a comma separated list, where each `li` gets a comma appended. If possible, end the `ul` or `ol` with a period?
