Twelve Websites is an ongoing project that I began in 2021 to [design](design.md) and build a series of small websites, each in the course of a month. Here's what I wrote about it at the start of the project: 

> I like to make websites. I've made a lot of them in the past.

> It takes a long time for me to make a website. Depending on the reason for making it, I often spend most of that time thinking, implementing something, changing my mind, and repeating the process. Sometimes I start with an interface in mind, but often the reason for creating the site evolves as it takes shape, so I shift what the interface is and refocus. Despite how long this takes, I like it because it means I get to spend a lot of time engaged in the experience of making. The process is, after all, the whole point. The end product is often not that impressive or interesting.

> I'd like to force a different way of approaching this. I want to see what happens when I am bounded by a timeframe; just one month to turn something that could be a website into a website. I have a very constrained amount of time to dedicate to this project, probably somewhere around 2-6 hours a week. That will require that what I make is simple in concept, design, and implementation.

> Of course this means what I make each month will be the product of less than 25 hours worth of effort. I don't want to make a shitty versions of what could be bigger websites, I want to make websites can be complete in less than 25 hours worth of effort. That means SIMPLE.

> To be honest I have no idea what simple really means in this context. The point of this project is to figure that out. What is simplicity in design, implementation, and process?
