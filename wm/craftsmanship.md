Take pride in your craft. It's how we progress towards our potential. 

I recently watched a video of some master craftsmen in Japan [build a house from the ground up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HMa5tofqps). It struck me that individual craftsmanship is just one part of it; there's also a larger community of craftsmen that's essential. Not only the individual but also the whole community moves towards this greater potential.
