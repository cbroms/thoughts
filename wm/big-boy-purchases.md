A big boy purchase is something you buy that requires a great deal of thought beforehand. 

When making big boy purchases, I spend the minimum of a week thinking about it. Often I spend a great deal longer. I spent about two months considering if I should purchase [a i-bought-a-typewriter](i-bought-a-typewriter.md), a tool that in the end cost me $125. I've been [debating replacing my laptop](the-fucking-laptop-class.md) for about three months now, and given that will cost me upwards of $2,000, I should continue on for quite a while longer before I make a decision. 

Everything that's not essential should, ideally, be a big boy purchase. Especially given the philosophy that [everything you acquire should have a plan](ownership.md); a lifespan with a clear end-of-life plan when it's passed on to the next caretaker.
