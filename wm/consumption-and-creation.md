One way to categorize my day is through the time spent  creating versus consuming. I feel best when the majority of the day is dedicated to creation, but not all of it. Usually at the end of the day I need to do [some consumption](media.md), in [moderation](moderation.md). 

Some people tend to get on a high horse and preach about the many benefits of *reading* [books](books.md) as opposed to watching movies and playing [video games](video-games.md) and such. While it might be true that reading is good for a whole host of reasons, for me at least it's generally more similar of an activity to watching a movie than writing, say. It's a consumptive activity as opposed to a creative one. 

When my brain's fried at the end of the day, I'll turn to a consumptive activity or start writing something [here](one-dimension.md). I've been enjoying replacing my usual consumptive activities with writing; it's a low-energy creative activity that feels better than most any sort of consumption.
