One way to categorize my day is through the time spent on creation and consumption. I feel best when the majority of the day is dedicated to creation, but not all of it. Usually at the end of the day I need to do [some consumption](media.md). 

Some people tend to get on a high horse and preach about the many benefits of *reading* as opposed to watching movies and playing [video games](video-games.md) and such. While it might be true that reading is good for a whole host of reasons, for me at least it's generally more similar of an activity to watching a movie than writing, say. It's a consumptive activity as opposed to a creative one.
