<p>If there’s any inspiration I could point to as most important to me, perhaps ever, it would have to be <a href="https://xanadu.com/">Project Xanadu</a>. I’m probably not the first to say that; Ted Nelson’s vision for the web was so essential, so elegant that I’m sure he’s inspired a great many of the designers and builders of today.</p>
<p>Ted’s <a href="https://youtu.be/hMKy52Intac">series describing the project</a> on <a href="youtube.md">YouTube</a> is perhaps the best summary one can give.</p>
