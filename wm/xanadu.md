If there’s any inspiration I could point to as most important to me, perhaps ever, it would have to be [Project Xanadu](https://xanadu.com/). I’m probably not the first to say that; Ted Nelson’s vision for the web was so essential, so elegant that I’m sure he’s inspired a great many of the designers and builders of today.

Ted’s [series describing the project](ttps://youtu.be/hMKy52Intac) on [YouTube](youtube.md) is perhaps the best summary one can give.
