It is astonishing to ponder just how complicated your hands are. 

Every movement that seems simple is far from it. It's a whole symphony of complicated little movements; each finger and bone in each finger moved in just the right way to get the overall hand to make an action. 

We think in terms of *grabbing* or *holding*, but there's so much that goes into these actions beyond just the action itself. It's an abstraction of a ton of complexity that we don't have to think about, but just happens unconsciously. As I type now for example, I'm thinking of the words and typing them, without at all considering what  letters need to be put in what order; my brain and fingers just sort of do all that.
