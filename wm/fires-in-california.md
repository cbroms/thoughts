[California's](california.md) landscape needs to burn. 

Building more infrastructure means more suppression, meaning hotter and more destructive fires. It's estimated [4.4 million acres per year](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112707004379) burned before 1800, and 2020's 4.5 million acres was seen as some sort of apocalypse. The orange skies were supposedly the first sign of some future climate-dystopia, it seems events like that historically would have been the norm for a California summer. 

I don't see a good solution here other than better management with controlled burns, as was done by Indigenous Californians. Building less [infrastructure in high-risk areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildland%E2%80%93urban_interface) (which is pretty much everywhere) might also be good to consider, as would thinking about how to live and build in such a way where a fire sweeping though every so often would not be the end of the world. It implies the need for a  new architecture and culture built around fires.
