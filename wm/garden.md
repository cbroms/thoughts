My partner and I are [building](build-it-yourself.md) a garden and growing some of our own food. I've gardened before, but it's always a great to get back to it; it feels like a necessary and meaningful endeavor.

I built a [raised planter bed](raised-planter-beds.md) and placed it in the sunniest part of the garden we can use. I also prepared an area of [ground to directly plant](direct-planting-vegetables.md) as well along the side of the house. It's a bit tricky since most of the ground we're working with is sideyard, and therefore shady at least half the day. The benefit is that we can grow lots of plants that wouldn't do so well in full sun, especially greens.

So far we've planted:

- [Kale](growing-kale.md)
- Collard Greens
- Radishes
- [Tatsoi](growing-tatsoi.md)
- Chard
- Basil
- Thyme
- Epazote
- Oregano
