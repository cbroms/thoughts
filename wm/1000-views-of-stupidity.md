![I got an email informing me that my website (One Dimension) received nearly 1,000 unique visitors last month. This I found to be a bit troubling, as it was never my intention for the site to actually be any sort of "destination.” I wanted a place where I could learn in public, but I always forget that the internet is a very strange place, and people somehow find their way. Of course, 1k people visiting the site is 'public' which was my original intention, so I’m not sure what I'm so worried about. I guess when I originally thought about what 'public' meant, it was a smaller number than 1k, or maybe there wasn't any a number associated with it at all. I guess the.idea is that I don't really want people reading this stuff. I like the idea of it because it forces me to write, and do it in a semi-presentable way. But I never wanted to think about an "audience" or even to have an audience. It's why this site shouldn't have any sort of delivery mechanism built in; there shouldn't be anyone to deliver it to. No email list, no RSS feed. But it will be open if you feel like clicking around. Another part of the problem is everything being written here is trash. Trash in the sense that it's just my random ill-informed opinion, man. Like everyone else, I don't know anything, and this is an attempt to figure it out, as much as is possible. People should not read into what's said as something to ponder and think about. It's just trash, disposable and cheap. If I ever feel like I have something to say, I'll put it somewhere people can find it. Thinking about this, I returned to perhaps one of the greatest rants I've encountered: Why I Fucking Hate Weblogs by Donald Brook: “Weblogs suck ass. What the fuck is up with this shit? Fuck. Who the fuck cares what these people think about? Nobody! … The problem, of course, is people. In general people are fucking stupid, and so many of the things they do are fucking stupid. I fucking hate weblogs, they are fucking stupid.” He thus begins his rant. I find it to capture something very true. We are all fucking stupid, myself included. This whole life-business is absurd. Anyway, that's a nice bracing start to the day. 8:10AM / 47F / High of 59F / Foggy, clearing](images/70279196/CXdtEZayhE-daily.webp "")
