Sometimes it feels like we're building more and more complex ways of doing absolutely nothing of value. 

[Foundation](https://foundation.app/), an NFT marketplace, is perhaps the most complex system for selling your softcore hentai collection (though what it is you're selling isn't even clear.) But money is changing hands (though that money is a bit on the complicated side too.)

Have there been other times in history when increased complexity and friction for simple tasks has led to a kind of degeneration of the structures that were once designed to accommodate those tasks?
