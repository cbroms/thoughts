![Nothing too much to note today. I realize I often type that then begin a long tirade about this or that. Not today. Today was mainly an "assorted tasks and relaxation day". We planned out our meals for the week. Went to the grocery store. Oh, we went to the asian grocery store for the, first time, which was pretty good. It was as you would expect for an asian grocery store: lots of incredible things, all wrapped in plastic. Then we went home and did some assorted gardening, and I logged all the weekly routine stuff. Made dinner, chatted, played some video games. A perfectly nice Sunday. As it should be. 9:54PM / Â·53F / High of 71F / Sunny, some high clouds](images/97275341/eeiBoshHMG-daily.webp "")
