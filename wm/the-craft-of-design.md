To be a true [craftsman](craftsmanship.md) of design likely includes:

- Being able to approach arbitrary problem spaces and gain an understanding of them. 
    - Understanding: an ability to scale between different resolutions; to look at problems both holistically and specifically, conceptually and concretely. 
- Being able to translate an understanding of a problem space into effective [boundary objects](boundary-objects.md). 
- Being able to iteratively advance toward some desired future through a [well-considered](design.md) set of changes to the problem space.
- Being able to carry out all of the above both alone and collaboratively.
