![In yesterday's page I mentioned that Sydney and I were thinking of moving someplace colder, and I thought maybe I'd riff on that a bit more. The goal is that eventually we purchase a bit of land and build our own home on it. Getting from here to there is the real challenge to figure out. There's the psychological challenge, of course, that comes with doing something like this. We've never done anything like this before, and it will take a lot of dedication and learning, as there's a ton we'll need to figure out for ourselves. Buying land and building on it is not just something that can be opted out of once started. No, you have to really stick to it, live it out and see where it takes you. So we have to be sure. There's also the social aspect of it. We're used to living in cities and suburbs, and as much as we both very much want to live in the country, we haven't done it before. The other consideration of course is money. The assumption we're making is that what we're planning can be done while we both still work remotely. I don't know if that's actually possible or not, but if it is that would be the best case scenario. I don't think either of as want to work in tech forever, but the idea is that we'll still be tech workers when we begin this endeavor. The reason for that is that to achieve full financial independence, we'll both probably need to work for maybe 10-15 years total, and we'd like to do this before that amount of time. The goal is that we buy land for under $100k, and build a house for under  $50k. These constraints will dictate what sort of land and what sort of house we can build. I don't want to be one of those people who have some ideal  dream house in mind and only set their sights on that, everything else not worth having. No, the goal here is some house, not the house. Eventually, of course, we'll build the house, but for quite a while and until we've first experimented with this small house and living in this minimal way. Only then can we really asses if this is the life that we actually want. So that s the idea. We both very much want this thing to happen, even if it's not in exactly the shape I outlined. Before then, we're talking about moving around and living a couple places for a year at a time. We're going to use these scouting trips to get a sense for different areas and climates, and to see what suits us best. 9:00AM / 59F / High of 72F / Sunny and clear](images/09153351/ZMwjbIMRts-daily.webp "")
