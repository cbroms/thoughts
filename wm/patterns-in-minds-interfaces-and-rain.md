![Today I think i finally figured out how to get the interface I've been working on for a while at work to look right. No, to feel right. All of the components are pretty much unchanged, the only difference is the layout. I added a top bar that brings together a bunch of the elements that used to be discrete into the same logical and visual home. And as soon as I tried it, the whole thing just sort of felt *correct.* I don't know how else to describe it, I just knew that it was a better approach. I don't think it's the sort of change you can get to rationally; I'd say that the layout that I had before was just as rational and made plenty of sense technically, It just didn't feel right. Funny how that is. It made me think of Christopher Alexander and patterns. I haven't read his work before, but from what I understand he describes the components of a house or town in terms of the patterns that are common between it and other of the same category of thing. If the building blocks of a house are the mental patterns we have, like the reading nook, and the components of those patterns are things like doors and windows, then there are similar sorts of things in interfaces. I suppose you might equate the doors, windows, stairs, and walls to text fields, dropdowns, buttons, and modals. The reading nook pattern perhaps is a particular arrangement of controls in a menu bar perhaps. It makes.immediate sense to use because it's familiar. I wonder what other parts of interfaces can be thought of in this pattern-oriented sort of way. I certainly didn't expect the layout that I ended up with today to be a recognizable pattern that felt right, if I did I probably would have already tried it. It just happened that it was, and I'd overlooked it. It's amazing how much of the world we just sort of intuit at this pattern-level. Rationalizing things sometimes feels like such a waste of time considering all that matters is that we have an immediate and intuitive understanding of something, and that's functional. Nice and rainy today. It's been a while since we had a good full rainy day. No actual downpour, more just a kind of mist or drizzle the entire day. One of those sorts of rains where you go out thinking you won't be wet, and come back from your walk soaked Without ever really noticing. 8:30PM / 54F / High of 54F / Drizzly and breezy all day](images/23688226/YoTPOSubll-daily.webp "")
