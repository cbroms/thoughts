![Finally got some folders to store my daily pages. So from now on these pieces of paper will be nicely held out of the dust, wind, and whatever else. I bought enough to be able to store pages related to other projects too. And that's the other thing I finally found, some white out. I looked for some when I bought this paper but they didn't have any, and I haven't been able to find any since. Until today at the FedEx store. I just realized using it then that it's pretty damn tricky to actually reach the page to white it out when it's in the typewriter. I need to figure out a good system for using it. I'm actually not totally sold on even using it much yet, as I kind of don't mind the backing up and rewriting over the messed up bit. It makes the OCR that I've been doing a real pain to correct though, so I'll give it a try for a little while. I realized I haven't really justified why I bother digitalizing these pages and sticking them up on One Dimension. It's just something that started happening when I began writing every day because 1D is just sort of the place where all my writing lives. Not really much thought beyond that. I /guess the one other thing that makes it worth it is that I get an accurate word count, so I can track how much writing I've done over the course of the month. That's kind of nice to know, as I think it's a pretty good indication of how distracted I've been. Anyway, I've been taking the general summary of each page I write and turning it into a little title, and posting those titles as my daily entry for my pages journal on FL. Going back through that journal today for the first time since I started, I tend to think that those titles are pretty much the only part of this project really worth saving. Not to say that there's nothing of value in the pages themselves (though any real value is surely few and far between in the massive s tack of pages next to my desk) but just that the short and pithy summary is honestly probably the only semi- interesting part for anyone other than myself, and probably mainly for myself too. Point is, I really need to figure out the best way of preserving and revisiting these pages, as I write them and then later on in the indeterminate future. Today I mostly just worked on my button website-button.land. I finally got it to look and feel *rightâ€¢. There's still more work to do, but it's getting there for sure. I think I'll put a cap on it for this week and revisit it on Sunday. It' one of those things that could get distracting from more difficult projects since it's so much fun to work on. Until next Sunday, then. 8:45PM / 52F / High of 63F / Partly cloudy](images/43161780/KpFUXeWZRp-daily.webp "")
