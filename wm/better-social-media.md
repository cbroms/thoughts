What is the best incarnation of a digital social system? The primary [design](design.md) challenge I see has to do with curation; how do you sort though what's generated by *everyone* to find what's meaningful to *someone*? 

*Individuals decide what kind of information they do and don't see.* 

Each user makes the choice what to see, not an algorithm. Simple enough.  

The next challenge, then, becomes an organizational one. How is information combined into common categories that an individual can select from? In a system where new information is generated constantly, these might be called "streams." 

How are streams created, combined, tuned into, tuned out of, contributed to, and talked about? These are no longer algorithmic questions. In fact, there's no algorithm at all. Just individual choices. 

I think that's the sort of foundation you'd need to have a social media that works.
