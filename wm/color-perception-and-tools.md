![Tonight I got totally captured by this little color palette generation problem. It's something I was working on at work, and then towards the end of the day I started thinking to myself that I should just write a little, tool to solve it. And so I did. Itâ€™s pretty sweet, basically what it does is spit out a color palette that is composed of the most visually-distinct colors as possible. What is visually-distinct turns out to be an interesting question, to figure that out you have to use a color space like CIELAB that's been adjusted to work with the human perceptual field. So as you make adjustments and choose colors that are a certain distance from one another, those distances aren't based on the actual distance between the colors, but rather an approximation of what we'd think is the distance. It's really interesting stuff. I'd like to finish this little. tool by the end of the weekend, that's my goal. 11:25PM / 56F / High of 67F / Foggy all day, bit of sun this evening.](images/59212396/RSMKrZUXEx-daily.webp "")
