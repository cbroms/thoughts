I recently passed 40,000 words on [One Dimension](one-dimension.md), and it has made me reflect a bit on the way working on a project like this is a bit like [an investment](investment.md). 

Every day I dedicate a little time to writing, revising, or linking thoughts. Naturally if I am able to keep this up, the number of thoughts, words, and connections grows. Eventually it gets to the point where the result is more than the sum of its parts. It becomes a sort of entity that exists on its own, beyond just a series of linked pages. 

I think this is quite unique property. By starting small and progressively building up, what results is something that's much more than any other project that I could start tomorrow, even if that project were "better" in some way. Despite One Dimension's roughness, it'll still be a formidable entity if I continue maintaining it (I suppose this is another way in which the [digital garden](digital-gardens.md) metaphor works well.)
