We went out to Lagunitas to see the [Coho salmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon) spawn today. 

I'd never seen something like it before. The salmon were way up the creek, in an offshoot of it near the Kent lake dam. They clustered around ponds and in little eddies beneath rapids. Their size was most surprising to me; they were huge. They looked like they were sized the ocean, in the context of the creek they were very large. 

On the bank there was a dead salmon and a vulture sitting over it between some ferns. A salmon slid by underwater upstream. It was a perfect little picture of the whole ecosystem, everything fitting together in [just the way that it should](the-nature-of-something.md).
