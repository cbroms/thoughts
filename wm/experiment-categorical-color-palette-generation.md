The goal of this experiment is to figure out how to create the most different-looking set of colors for a visualization. 

There's a bit about this around the web, but I'm unimpressed by the solutions out there. I'd like a few different constraints: 

- 8-20 colors (though could be more, I suppose)
- A parameterized range of lightnesses (not too dark)
- Colorblind friendly
