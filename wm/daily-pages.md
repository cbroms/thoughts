I'm going to start a practice of writing a page of notes a day.

Right now I already write everyday; creating new thoughts and pruning existing ones [within my interlinked writing system](one-dimension.md). This will be a bit of a different endeavor, more about daily journaling. Things will be quick and off-the-cuff, generally following some kind of a similar format. And I'll be indexing these notes too, which is a bit of a change of pace for this site where everything is otherwise only accessible through forward and backlinks.

Unlike the other thoughts on this site, these pages won't be updated. Once published, they'll remain in whatever form they are in. I recently acquired [a i-bought-a-typewriter](i-bought-a-typewriter.md), so that should also help with the concreteness factor.

Let's see what happens.
