I'm not sure why I like collections of things--sets of artifacts of the same sort of category. It's even better when these artifacts are very pedestrian and don't have a particularly significant or well-recognized existence on their own. I came across [an entire article on the different sorts of tables used by the park service](http://npshistory.com/publications/park_structures_facilities/secg.htm). It's a perfect example of is sort of thing; collections of utilitarian, not-so-flashy objects.

I think it has something to do with celebrating the objects' object-ness, [their own true nature](the-nature-of-something.md).
