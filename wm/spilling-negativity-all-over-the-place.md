Some days I feel like I'm spilling negativity all over the place. 

It's like I get on a train of thought, being critical, and just keep going. [Ranting is fun](in-praise-of-rants.md), what can I say... The negativity compounds and builds on itself, getting more and more intense. 

But it feels pretty vacuous. But then again, most of the world is pretty vacuous, so maybe this is an appropriate response.

There I go again!
