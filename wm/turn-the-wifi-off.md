Ever since we moved into this house, I've turned the WiFi off every night. 

The only place to hook up the router and modem is quite close to where we sleep, and it made me a bit nervous (irrationally, maybe, [maybe not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87_4nHEPHyU).) It just became something that I do every night now, and it seems to me to make quite a bit of sense, even if the router wasn't right next to my head. 

Why have something on if you're not using it? You wouldn't leave the sink on when you're not using it, so why do the same with the WiFi? It uses energy, like everything else. Just click it off. 

Maybe there's [a principle](uncertainties.md) in there, something like "wastefulness  is still wastefulness, regardless of scale."
