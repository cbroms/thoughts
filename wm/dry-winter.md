I don't like it when it's winter in [California](california.md) and it's 63 degrees, sunny, and dry.

There's something that feels very wrong about that. It's too warm for a jacket but too cool for just a t-shirt. It's always breezy too so that makes it even more awkward. And the dryness is less-than-ideal.

Every winter it seems there's a long period of dryness and blue skies. The rain should be there, but it's not. They call it a "ridge" that sits over the coast of the state. Oregon is nice and wet all winter, but California not so much.

Oh, well. Makes the rain even better when it does come.
