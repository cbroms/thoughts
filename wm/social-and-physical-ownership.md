NFTs introduce a new sense of ownership, but NFT-ownership is a different sort of ownership than what you get in the physical world. It's not an intuitive sort of ownership. 

In the intuitive sense, I might make a `.txt` file that sits on my desktop and I *own it*. I own the physical hardware, I made the data, it’s mine. That’s very clear.

Through the internet I can move that file around, and people who download it can own it too. There’s no difference between the copied downloaded version and the version on my desktop. But both I and the people that download the file feel they own it because it's on their local computer. If it’s on a shared server somewhere, I don’t feel as strongly that I own it; for example I don’t feel like I own a Spotify playlist but I do feel like I own a folder of mp3s. [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) produced an excellent [essay about local-first digital ownership](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/). 

So what does ownership mean when applied to NFTs? It seems like it’s something more to do with a *social* version of ownership. Of all the things floating around the internet, here is a way to say “that is my thing”. In this case “my thing” isn’t the sort of ownership I described above, it’s a more social form. It’s everyone else saying “I trust this system, this system says you own it, so you own it”. Other people can have the same file that I have, it just happens that there’s this independent system that lets everyone know that the file is mine within the abstract world of all files. The file itself can exist outside of that, physically on someone else’s computer.

NFTs introduce a different kind of ownership than the  conventional sort you might expect when it comes to objects. It’s much more social and less physical. Obviously in the real world social and physical intertwine, but in digital-land not so much.
