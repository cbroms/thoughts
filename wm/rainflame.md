The goal of Rainflame is to create high-quality simple digital tools. 

## RF1 

The first tool, RF1, is for managing stock portfolios, specifically rebalancing. There are no free online tools for rebalancing or determining which assets should be purchased at a buy-in. RF1 will provide these tools for free in a simple, local-first system.
